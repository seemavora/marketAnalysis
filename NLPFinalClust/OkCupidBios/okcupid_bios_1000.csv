0,"about me:  i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual: either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to only wear leather shoes dress shoes.  about you:  you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a good attention span."
1,i am a chef: this is what that means. 1. i am a workaholic. 2. i love to cook regardless of whether i am at work. 3. i love to drink and eat foods that are probably really bad for me. 4. i love being around people that resemble line 1-3. i love the outdoors and i am an avid skier. if its snowing i will be in tahoe at the very least. i am a very confident and friendly. i'm not interested in acting or being a typical guy. i have no time or patience for rediculous acts of territorial pissing. overall i am a very likable easygoing individual. i am very adventurous and always looking forward to doing new things and hopefully sharing it with the right person.
2,"i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before the world.  i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result, you are probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid you, but that seems silly.  as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are too."
3,i work in a library and go to school. . .
4,"hey how's it going? currently vague on the profile i know, more to come soon. looking to meet new folks outside of my circle of friends. i'm pretty responsive on the reply tip, feel free to drop a line. cheers."
5,"i'm an australian living in san francisco, but don't hold that against me. i spend most of my days trying to build cool stuff for my company. i speak mandarin and have been known to bust out chinese songs at karaoke. i'm pretty cheeky. someone asked me if that meant something about my arse, which i find really funny.  i'm a little oddball. i have a wild imagination; i like to think of the most improbable reasons people are doing things just for fun. i love to laugh and look for reasons to do so. occasionally this gets me in trouble because people think i'm laughing at them. sometimes i am, but more often i'm only laughing at myself.  i'm an entrepreneur (like everyone else in sf, it seems) and i love what i do. i enjoy parties and downtime in equal measure. intelligence really turns me on and i love people who can teach me new things."
6,life is about the little things. i love to laugh. it's easy to do when one can find beauty and humor in the ugly. this perspective makes for a more gratifying life. it's a gift. we are here to play.

9,"my names jake. i'm a creative guy and i look for the same in others.  i'm easy going, practical and i don't have many hang ups. i appreciate life and try to live it to the fullest. i'm sober and have been for the past few years.  i love music and i play guitar. i like tons of different bands. i'm an artist and i love to paint/draw etc. and i love creative people.  i've got to say i'm not too big on internet dating. you cant really get an earnest impression of anyone from a few polished paragraphs. but we'll see, you never know."
10,"update: i'm seeing someone, so off the market :)  i have blue eyes, live in the mission, love to laugh and make people smile. i'm a social liberal. honesty impresses me, i'm not a fan of lying unless it involves soft grass or a bed. i've heard that lots of gents on the cupid lie about/exaggerate their height. i am in fact 5'10.5"", for whatever that's worth. i love female energy. i am endlessly fascinated by women, and the best thing about okc is that i get to meet independent and interesting girls that i would never have encountered in my daily life. i'm very comfortable to be around and i have fun helping people overcome problems or gain fresh insights into their personalities.  favorite spirit:single malt scotch go-to drink:jack&coke favorite beers: kostritzer, hoegaarden beers i'm more likely to actually be drinking: pabst, tecate, miller with breakfast: irish coffee personality type: enfj"
11,"i was born in wisconsin, grew up in iowa, and moved to california three years ago for a combination of work opportunity and just wanting to live in sf. it took me a couple years to get to the peninsula, but i'm glad i eventually got here. i'm passionate about people and have a wide variety of interests and talents.  i'm also continually learning about myself. for example, i'm learning very recently that as a result of spending all my time growing up, in college, and for the last five years focusing on growing my ""deep relationship"" skills, i'm not as good as i previously thought at initializing friendships/relationships. i guess that isn't all a bad thing since the ""first impression"" thing only really happens once with each person. :)  as a result, i love my friends, i've got a lot of deep friendships, and know how much richer a friendship can get as it gets deeper.  i'm passionate about music, i play the guitar, write songs (less now than before), write plays (more now than before), want to learn french and asl, am pretty good for an amateur ballroom dancer, can do almost everything moderately well (seriously, no joke), love bright ties and shoes, am a jacket and jeans person, and absolutely love figuring out how people tick. i think i'm pretty cool and wish more people would be patient enough to take the time to see that.  every friend i've ever had say i'm nothing like anyone else. so i don't come off like anyone else. i'm my own person. and i'm proud of that."

16,"i just moved to the bay area from austin, tx (originally from louisiana). i do audio programming for video games, and just started at a game studio out here. yes, i am a bit of a nerdy programmer, but i don't have it stamped across my forehead - i don't even really play video games all that often. i actually create/play music way more often in my spare time.  i'm starting a new life here in ca and really excited about it. i only knew one person in this area when i moved here, but i wasn't worried - i always make friends pretty quickly. in every city i've lived, i've made at least a few life-long friends. i'm definitely looking to do the same thing here.  i'm a very easy to get along with kind of person. i always try to avoid over-complication. i have no time for bullshit, and i would expect the same from anyone i'm close to and/or respect.  i'm very much into doing things outside and living a healthy/fit lifestyle. i'm really looking forward to doing some camping, backpacking, biking, etc in ca. i also really enjoy going out for a nice meal and some tasty cocktails or beer, or doing the music nightlife thing. i dj (drum n bass) from time to time, and i've already landed a few gigs in the bay area. i'm very much involved in dnb and other electronic genres, but i love live music just as much.  basically ... life, to me, is about working hard and playing hard. i've made a lot of sacrifices and invested much effort to get myself into an industry where those two can often overlap, which is something i'm fairly proud of myself for. i've learned a lot of cool stuff so far and i plan to continue doing that. i'm pretty excited to see where that will take me :d"
17,"to sum myself in whole: i have adventurous tendencies with a somewhat vulgar flare (i hope you can take a joke-offensive or not).  i'm a constant seeker of discovering something new, whether it be a different restaurant, culture, or music (anything really). i tend to have an eclectic personality.  i volunteer and participate with a lot of activities with my community. i also tend to seek those who have a story, any story. i'm all ears! i want to learn from you, hear what you have to say, and relate it to my own personal experience.  i'm a bit of a nerd and like to watch the history, military, and discovery channel. something about militaristic strategies intrigue me.  i'm a bit of a tom boy, so i indulge in shooting guns, playing video games, and working out consistently. i also have the guilty pleasure of watching ridiculous comedy (family guy, curb your enthusiasm, it's always sunny ...just to name a few)"
18,"some of my favorite things: riding my motorcycle on curvy roads curling up with the next book in the series finding great photographs building things joking around with my friends, finding funny moments the stars windy days living near the beach love and compassion music cooking dinner with a friend  sometimes i'll take a different route, just to see where it goes.  my photos are available on facebook, for a peak of some of those unguarded moments :p"
19,"i relocated to san francisco half a year ago. that was an awesome few months that let me explore the diverse parts of the city, find a gorgeous victorian house to live in, meet my awesome roommates who became my best friends, find my first american emotional soul-mates, ride hot european wheels on the hilly streets of san francisco and the winding road to stinson beach, swim in the freezing waters of the bay, walk the ocean beach at full moon on warm, starry nights, experience the great outdoors hiking and cross-country skiing, fall in love with the local diversity and openness, abundance of cuisine, and embracement of active lifestyle.  this is the most awesome city to live in, and one where you can loose yourself in a continuous chase of newelties and adventure. and the people around will only support you in that amazing run for new experiences. having been absorbing this atmosphere for the past six months, i'm finally revelling in the clamness that i find inside me once again. like you, maybe, and so many bright people here, i've come to embrace this city as home. and i'm beginning to stabilize and live a well paced life, with time for personal and professional growth, fun with close friends, sports that keep the balance of my body and mind, and with the time to ponder and reflect on my way through life."
20,"i grew up in a small town in the midwest and have moved around a lot over the last few years, last stop was chicago before calling sf home. i've been here for 2 years now and love the city....the people, the food, the randomness, and the endless to-dos.  i've always said i would try anything once, so giving this a shot and see what happens...."
21,"my name is ashley and i live in san francisco. i love to dance, speak spanish, smile, and enjoy life! :)"
22,"i tend to think the same way a comedian does about nearly everything and i laugh more than any other particular activity. adventures are a key ingredient to my happiness, whether it be a new restaurant, hike, or sport i'm usually forging ahead toward something new. you coming?"
23,"here's a completely fake summary i wrote while feeling coy: i like nature. you know like plants, sticks, stuff like that. if i like a girl, i'll do special things for her. like, i might wear a do-rag or maybe spray paint her car, little things. if i'm really crushin' on a girl, i'll light some incense, put on my fancy robe, and sing her kid rock songs while i cook us some hamburger helper.  ok, for real now: i'm a bit clumsy, but i'm an expert at silly dancing. i grew up in a ghost town and i like living simply. i enjoy subtlety, creativity, nostalgia, and quaint old-fashioned things. i make mistakes, but i always try to do the right thing. i am not a rich man, but i've got a heart of gold.  i am honest, good-natured, and the bee's knees"
24,"bay area transplant six years or so now, straight outta tennessee, play sum musick ,make sum things,, goes to some shows, prefers personal interaction to social interaction, .... but like to go out alot, ,, everybody shuld stop and smell the roses at the same time and then lets see what wuld happen, ..... i swear i'm not really a bad speller, just have a unique method of typing, .... don't have a car but a really good driver, .. think i'm generally pretty pleasant person to hang with but i dunno you tell me, ..... like to ride my bike really slowly,, i don't have a helmet, people think i look like 'weezer' all of them i guess? but i don't really see the resemblance"
25,"hey to all, hope all is well and your having a great summer! i've been in denver and won't be back till the 12th or so. talk to you then.  i am currently work as a graphic designer focused on marketing and advertising. i graduated from the university of colorado at boulder class of '07. i am humble, energetic, willing, optimistic, honest and have a lot of gratitude. i live for today and in the moment and that is important to me. i believe in succcess without stepping on toes. i am positive and strive to be the best i can be.positivity and humor are key for me...laughter is my specialty.  i am looking to meet new friends and possibly something more. i have no expectations, but keep my eyes open for that special girl to see where it goes.  i consider myself to be a gentleman, but a child at heart with a lot of energy! i don't mean in an immature way, just a lot of fun and down to do anything. i was raised in a good family. i have been lucky enough to travel around the world and plan on keeping that up.  i enjoy japanese culture, oahu's beautiful oceans (north shore- waimea bay, pipeline, kailua, makapu, sandy's), music!!!, having my dog by my side, staying in and watching movies, dating sweethearts, my ipad and iphone, dining, traveling, snowboarding, fly fishing, camping, watching pro sports, aimlessly running around the city, watching movies in bed, taking you to the driving range, surfing with my older brother, cycling, going to shows in the city and going out with friends."
26,"full-time student, full-time square. i change from year to year. used to love computer games, and drinking, but am finding i hate them more as time passes. don't get me wrong. i still enjoy a night out every other month and a lazy saturday with my computer now and again. my obsession of the moment include long drives at night after work and hitting the gym. on the weekends i like to sit and home and prepare for the week ahead."
27,"i suck at these things, but here it goes. i'm a laid back guy that likes to just have fun. i'm currently working full time at a retail job as management, not the best job out there, but i enjoy it. i love to be outdoors any chance i get, whether it be hiking, going to a park, or just going to a theme park."
28,"i moved here recently and love this place. i'm a half-urban, half-mountain guy, devoted to the walkable/bikeable/transit-rideable city, and to getting out in the wilderness to remember that it exists. i love this progressive free-thinking city, where people are active and politically active and whimsical. and where i hear people speaking a dozen languages every time i get coffee/get on bart/go anywhere.  so far, i've been a biologist, a science teacher, a traveler, an outdoor adventure guide, and a couple other things. i'll stay the teaching route for the moment while i figure out my path in to working on some kind of sustainability policy or work for ensuring accurate science education.  i laugh out loud.  i'm a balance of things: intellectual and active and creative. i'll geek out over a scientific journal, then go do some work on a sculpture or painting. days need some active time: riding bikes, walking places, helping out friends or friends-of-friends with moving or fixing things (i genuinely love this; i need something useful to do with my hands). i stay in shape and care about being fit so i can be healthy and strong enough to do the things i like to do.  i'm fun, driven, bright, grounded, comfortable with myself. i hope you are too. also, i'm grown up, you know? i'm emotionally available and mentally healthy. i don't play hot and cold games or try too hard to charm you / get obsessive / chase you when you're a little out of reach. i'll respect you as my equal. i have two little sisters so i'm well aware a lot of men play the charmer/politician act, and also keep a collection of women on strings. as i told my sobbing, heartbroken littlest sis at christmas, those dudes are what they are, and they're not gonna change. and i don't want to be them.  basically, i'm happy to be out here. it feels like there's so much to explore and i'd love to explore it with someone smart and energetic who's been here maybe over a year and can show me around. outdoorsy would be great, but it isn't a requirement for dating. be extremely passionate and driven about something you care about, that's all."
29,"i'm told i can get along with anyone - a product of growing up in small town minnesota where if i had talked only to people that i related with i'd have gone through my days mostly mute (half kidding)  i can fall asleep anywhere any time. it's a gift. i'm like a puppy  may i never be too old for impromptu living room dance parties  a warm sf night is one of my favorite things. it makes me feel like i've just stolen something from nature and gotten away with it  i'm offended by the rubiks cube  never been good at one night stands  love to read, write and make music. i have to deliberately set time aside for the more quiet and thoughtful pursuits because these city lights can be...so shiny. i'm a social creature. i like being around people  self deprecating humor will get you everywhere with me  it is difficult to get the news from poetry but people die miserably everyday for lack of what is found there - william carlos williams  i consider myself an ""actor"" but haven't done it for a while. i also performed in an improv troupe for several years. i've let that part of myself be taken over by the 9 to 5. i resolve to get it back  i enjoy fashion and aesthetics but they intimidate me like crazy. really i'm just on this site to find someone who can keep me from wearing holiday sweaters  big ol' npr fan. this american life! forgetaboutit  mood lighting, johnny walker on the rocks and good company are all i want for my birthday. the day after, however, i want to pack a picnic and drive up the coast  i'm a mean tennis player, as in, i'm pretty good, not really mean"
30,"iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.... i hate talking about myself. i just moved to sf from austin. i'm reinventing. i spend my time finding thrills with good company, or solo. i party less than i used to....my greatest ambition is to make the most of my life, gaining as much knowledge, wisdom, and experience as i can. i believe that happiness requires nothing more than a positive attitude. i like to be excited/scared. all things music... water... reading, absorbing, maturing, daydreaming, enjoying, indulging.. less.. and am always laughing to myself. traveling is big in my to-do lists. is this an interview? i'm over it. youll have to excuse my lack of on okcupid. real life is mo betta."
31,"to life, love and loot  i like smart, funny, and strong woman. i have been called picky. i think its a consequence of being honest.  i'm a boston convert. i've been in sf for 3 years and have explored as much as i can, but theres plenty of more to do.  my life plan: (1) bust my ass creating a company (2) sell it or ipo (3) take mini-retirements around the world (4) use my time exactly how i want... travel, create more companies, invest or something i haven't thought of yet"
32,"much more to add, but this is a start...  i am a mixture of silliness and seriousness, but the most important thing to me is genuineness! i don't believe in always taking life seriously as there is much to laugh at in our daily rat race! i've been told by many that i have a very adaptable personality so i can mesh with many types of people... also that they find it's almost impossible to have a ""surface"" conversation with me.  i like to make things fun. ""bored"" is strictly prohibited from my vocabulary... i'm the type of girl who tries to make the best of every situation (even the frustrating ones).  i love everything from curling up on the couch to a movie... to staying out all night in vegas to camping/hiking in yosemite... to playing pool/darts in a dive-bar (nice bars are okay too)... to long drives with the top down... to relaxing days at an art museum, to nights out at concerts/plays/dancing... to sun shining down on me at the beach, on the deck at sam's in tiburon, anywhere near water.... and i absolutely love riding my bike....  i am very passionate about travel and am explorative enough to go by myself to other countries without reservations. i have a lot more ground to cover, but i've been to costa rica (4x), peru, chile, ecuador, jamaica, canada, mexico (shamefully been to cabo 7 times lol). i'd really love to go to brazil next, but it may be germany/france, since i have places to stay."
33,"""apparently,"" has become a new favorite word of mine, like ""perpendicular."" it's fun to say don't you think? do you have any favorite words?  perrrr piiinnn diiic uuulaarrr  as naturally for myself, i'm laid back, ummm... witty, and uber sarcastic. i cannot really describe myself without the fear of sounding... vain. always been a happy chick and i tend to have a good time everywhere i go and i also tend to dance out of nowhere. it's my thang, ya dig? what comes after happiness? humor? sure, humor. it's a little dark, a little vulgar, and it involves making fun of myself and my friends. have you ever played ""your team?"" i appreciate everything in life. my friends, my family, my co-workers, a blanket, nature, the city. psh! even those creepy crawlies! i also say thank you a lot because i enjoy making others feel appreciated and important. it totally boosts their esteem up! it makes me happy!  i swear too much by the way. hehe.  can't think of anything else. i was born and raised in norcal??  let's be friends or whatever."
34,"i grew up near sacramento, moved to sf for school, and stayed here once i got a job after graduating. so except for a bit of traveling, i've lived on northern california all my life. i hope to explore some of the other places on my long list of cities i'd like to live in, but in the meantime, i love it here in san francisco.  i enjoy artistic, creative things and like going to museums and concerts. a big passion of mine is storytelling; i love movies, books, and tv that have good story and characters. discussing all these things is almost as much fun as consuming them. i make my humble contribution to visual storytelling through the occasional bit of animation, short film, and photography.  i'm a big do-it-yourselfer and like working with my hands; i would rather fix it myself than call someone to fix it....this usually doesn't end in disaster.  i'm introverted and sometimes a little too shy, but underneath that i'm pretty bright and witty. an understanding and appreciation of sarcasm and a smart sense of humor are pluses."
35,new here. coming soon ;)
36,i lost a needle in a haystack once....and found it! that pretty much sums me up!
37,"let's go to a festival and dance all night... running and dancing with the stars. we will not rest until our naked bodies have melted away and the awesome beauty of life, death, and the universe becomes so clear. after which we will finish that bottle of jameson and hold each other close, laughing at our friends and welcoming the sunrise. a new day of adventure awaits.  i am looking for many things: friendships, drinking/hiking/sports buddies, love interests, adventure partners, business opportunities... you name it. i am a social animal and appreciate human interaction, so i am always interested in meeting new people regardless of ""who"" or ""what"" they are. in practice, and in mannerisms, i seem like quite the ""typical"" guy: i love to drink beer, play sports, i listen to reggae, dubstep and hip-hop, and enjoy a beach full of bikini-clad women as much as anyone. however, yes, i can also be a bisexual, swinging, polyamorous, and debaucherous individual. but that is just a part of me, and all that really means anyway is i'm open minded. i have always fully imagined marrying and having kids one day, but i'm open to whatever life may bring. while i am secretly and totally a hopeless romantic, i am not trying to rush in to things or grow up too fast. i strive in my daily life to be relaxed and down-to-earth, but still adventurous... i try not to take the day-to-day of life too seriously. :-)  a note on ""bisexuality"": for you hetero-normative folk: do not be afraid of the term ""bisexual"". it is just a term, and a very limiting one at that. i am just as heterosexual as a ""straight man"". i am just as homosexual as a ""gay"" man. and just because i may be bisexual and perhaps polyamorous, does not mean that i am unable to be in a happy, committed, and fulfilling relationship with a single partner. in fact, such an arrangement has been my norm."
38,"why, hello there.  i'm entertaining the thought that i could come across someone just as equally rad, bodacious and fun who blows my mind and our exchange develops into something too good for words. i'm a riot with a good heart.  oakland made me, the east bay raised me, lived in vegas, the silicon valley catapulted my career, and now i am planting seeds in sf near(ish) my home in walnut creek.  i've learned enough of my mother's native lingo to find my way back to the beach and enough exotic languages to fall in love. i'm visual, a soulful vocalist, a believer in exploring passions, positive action, and celebrating often. i know when to fold and when to raise. i set my own standard. i'm well-loved by my diverse family and friends. i have no enemies but time. entj. i love dancing and how sexy you look in a fedora and dark shades. i love me some super high heels just as much as my daisy dukes and rugged boots when i rough it with my dogs. i love to explore. so pack yer bags darlin, or keep one next to mine in the trunk.  i'm resilient and direct because i've been there, learned that, and i trust you have, too.

39,"i love life!  oh. okcupid is telling me that three words isn't enough. ok then:  i just moved to the bay area in february, i don't know anyone here. this is your chance - you can pretend to be the coolest kid in town and i won't know any better but to believe you!  still not enough? fine... a more detailed description of me:  born to lead the armies of darkness to ruinous victory. gifted with a vast range of abilities for achieving that destiny. cursed by the forces of good to be crippled by ethics, honesty, and compassion. the usual story - good triumphs over evil, foiled again, blah blah blah.  i can read and write my name, and i have a job and a home and a car and my teeth and i can use an oscilloscope and i can shower myself!  you should also know that of all the people on a recently-published ""50 most loathsome people in the usa"" list, not a single one of them is me. your mom will be delighted to hear this.

40,"i am new to the san francisco bay area and looking for new friends and people who would like to introduce me to their favorite places.  -inglorion- is...  - yet another friendly guy stuck in front of a computer  - ... and liking it!  seriously, i am a computer programmer (both profesionally and as a hobby), so naturally i spend quite some time at my computer. but there are so many fun things in life that this page couldn't possibly contain them all. just to name a few, i like sailing, speaking foreign languages, cycling, taking walks, parties, and hugs.  i also spend some effort trying to make the world a better place, caring for the environment, conserving energy, thinking about politics and animal rights (including human rights), and, by writing open source software that anybody is invited to use, share, and improve. more about that on my website: http://inglorion.net/  i'm always looking forward to making new friends and having fun together. if you're up for that, too, don't hesitate to send me a message!  i am humorous, considerate, and sometimes passionate  (note: i've started over answering the match questions. this will take a while.)"

42,"i'm an optimist with a healthy sense of impending doom, an artist and traveler who's also jazzed about my soul sucking office job in squaresville (emeryville).  ...aaand i'm going to finish this later. being this clever takes a lot out of me, and also makes me hate myself. until then here's a joke:  a guy walks into a bar or something.  ...i'm going to finish that later too."
43,"i don't really like summarizing myself; but who does, right? seems like every time i try i come up with a pile of contradictions. i'm a shy extrovert i'm a grounded dreamer i'm a lazy adventurer i'm open-minded, but sometimes stubborn i'm a city person, i'm a mountain man i can be very competitive, but try to avoid competition i'm very social, i'm a bit misanthropic i'm generally very meticulous, i'm often sort of careless i have a strong sense of self, i'm a social chameleon i have complete confidence in myself to succeed at whatever i do, yet i'm often terrified of failure/letting others down. a lot of my best friends didn't like me when they first met me. but when they took the time to get to know they figured out that i'm actually a very caring, entertaining, giving, honest, loyal, patient, playful, open, and stimulating companion. of course others love me at first sight and never stop. so maybe you should just see for yourself.  i am clever, creative, and complicated"

54,"okay, i'm long overdue to give this an honest shot. i'd done the normal routine and have found decent long term relationships, but have yet to find the right one.  i'm not looking for games or ridiculous drama. i'm a pretty straight forward guy that values honesty and good communication. when i find the right person, i'm very devoted and sincere -- and i hope to find the same in a partner.  as for who i am, i enjoy anything from various physical activities to zoning out in front of a good movie, to exploring some previously unexplored land -- or just an unexplored road. i like cooking or baking when i have someone to share that with, and really i'm up for trying most new things.  i value intelligence and insightful conversation. i love when i meet someone who is passionate about a subject i know little about. i'm happy debating almost anything even if it means playing devil's advocate. critical thought and logic are a big part of how i've grown up and defined myself and my beliefs.  and then, of course, i also need to be able to let my guard down and have fun making bad jokes or indulging in some offhand sarcasm. to be able to let the little kid out who is fascinated poking around in tide pools and also amused by the jelly bean dispenser that ""poops"" the candy ... that's what keeps life fun and beautiful.  last think i have to say is, along with not caring for games, i have no need for conventions and am very open minded. feel free to contact me if i simply haven't managed to notice you yet, if you're so inclined. it's flattering and a big plus in my book when someone can admit what they're intrigued by.  hope to hear from you, -alex"

57,"i grew up in iowa. it gets a bad rap, but let me be the first to tell youiowa is way cooler than you think. after iowa i went to school in pittsburgh. now i'm spending the summer in san francisco and living in soma.  i'm the did you know guy: i'm always researching and analyzing. if i know a friend is working on a project i'll send them relevant ideas and articles i come across. however, my intellectual prowess doesn't permeate to all aspects of my life. my friends make fun of me for being an absent-minded-professor type. give me hard problem and i'll excel, but moving out of my apartment? it might as well be rocket science. eek, there's always room for improvement!  i love the sound of plane tires touching down in a country i've never visited. japan is next on my list, though i'd visit germany or london again in a heartbeat.  there's a more intuitive side to my life, too. recently i've been enthusiastically exploring buddhism and meditation, paying attention to the spaces in between things. the more i learn the less i know. it's so refreshing to be awash in the mystery of the universe.  style is important to me. i'm all for expression through clothing but draw the line at pajamas as outerwear. i get it, they're comfortable, but ya know... just saying."

(2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden, meditate, do arty things, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start and almost never finish. (3) i own three chess sets, but don't play chess. (4) in people, i like a precise mix of church giggles and smoldering contemplation; my friends, failing to achieve the impossible, tend to gravitate dramatically toward one extreme or the other. (5) i am deeply offended by bad art, and i'm not sure why. (6) i am not above eating an entire plate of kale and then going to smoke a cigarette. (7) i can yawn without moving my face. (8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter self-absorption. (9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators. (10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years. (11) i can never seem to stand up straight, but when i do: watch out. my height has been described by some as ""gangly"" and others as ""elven"", which to me are two very different things. i have also been told i resemble a ""bundle of sticks."" (12) my best friend once told me that if i turned out to be a figment of her imagination she wouldn't be surprised, which we agreed was both an enormous compliment and a colossal insult. (13) my pet peeves include people who make noise in movie theaters, a lopsided pasta/sauce ratio, and those who take a really long time in single-occupancy public restrooms even though they know others are waiting because the door handle has jiggled like seven times. also, i think people who feel they're too good to bag their own groceries are disgusting. (14) ""winged migration"" has been in my netflix queue for 4 years. (15) i have 35 plants in my room, a la max from where the wild things are. (16) i am happy with my life, and it'd be swell to share it with someone. (17) i don't talk about myself this much in person."

82,"i moved to sf ~7 months ago, and so far i'm really liking it, but i'm looking to grow my circle of friends and hitting it off with a cute girl along the way is even better.  my latest interest is rock climbing. i've been going 3x/week to planet granite and having a blast. so perhaps a good way to meet if you als climb is just to be tr belay partners.  i'm originally from the chicago area, which is still where my very small family lives, but for the last 8 years enjoying the beaches, mountains and deserts in san diego.  i'm an adventurer by heart, and always seeking something out of the ordinary, to challenge me, to spark my imagination, or simply surprise me when i'm least expecting it. my ideal girl would do the same.  i've traveled to many places in the world, but there's still a ton left for me to see, and a major goal is to find a girl that shares this travel bug with me. at some point in the next few years, i'd love to quit my job to travel for ~1yr with a girl i love, and then return to the normal us life/career, with both our lives enriched."
83,"i love many things, laughing however is at the top of that list. i'm kind of a goofball, but in a subtle ways for the most part. dry humour, sarcasm. i guess i just find humour/interest in many things that most people don't even notice. i'm quirky...but endearingly so (or so people say). i spend a lot of time looking for new (to me, anyway) music to add to my collection, looking for interesting events/activities/hobbies to try out around the city and revising mental maps of where i'd like to end up eventually. i love hunting for just the right vintage pieces. naturally, i'm an etsy whore, and can be found perusing vintage furniture stores, especially the alameda county antique fairs. my most recent vintage purchase was a gorgeous grundig majestic record console, i do believe it's my favourite piece of furniture i own now.  i like trying out cozy new places to eat, and new recipes, but i'm not by any stretch of the mind a 'foodie'. i frequent wine bars and coffee shops, bay area staples. i _love_ the beach...i totally appreciate being relatively close to the beach, after having lived in ny, where the beach was neither close to the city nor worthwhile. i like finding fun new ways of being active, like finding new trails to jog, paths to bike or walls to climb. going on spontaneous adventures is one of my favourite things to do, and a fun way to get to know people. i love all things creative, so art walks, gallery openings, live performances, museums, activities that involve creating art, are all places that i tend to gravitate towards...and i'm always looking for more people to that are also into these kinds of events.  i'm into technology, particularly mobile, which is the industry i work in. it's a long story as to how i got here, but it's where i want to be and i actually don't hate my job. i tweet and facebook. and read tech blogs like engadget and gigaom to keep up with the current goings on with the latest gadgets. but, i also read magazines like juxtapoz, big up, etc. because i love them and for the way it offsets the techier stuff in my line up.  when it comes to friends, i'm super loyal and i think respect is important. bad communication in any relationship, friendship or otherwise is the kiss of death in my opinion, and a personal pet peeve of mine. i like to be as up front as possible in most situations...even if that's not what the person wants to hear.  eventually, i'd love to settle down with someone who i really enjoy, respect, and feel a strong connection with. ideally, i'd like for that person to be pretty different from me, into their own scene, but still have some interests overlap with mine. i don't really like to rush into dating, but when i find someone i like, i tend to want to spend time, and get to know them. i'm a cuddler. and a hand holder. and a just because-er. and likely, a professional grade spooner. although dating-wise, this past year has been very mismatched for me, as it seems that i haven't been into the people that have been into me, and vice versa. hopefully eventually, a mutual dig will occur...i wouldn't settle for anything less.  things i <3. traveling, learning languages, hand-knit goods, mixed tapes, diptyque candles, architecture, good investments, creativity, ink, intelligent speculation, kindred souls, scorpios, animal rescue and rehabilitation, paths less traveled, documentaries, acoustic guitars, the beach, thunderstorms, cozy coffee shops, positivity, underdogs, survivors, deviation from the norm, any type of gadgetry esp mobile technology, boxee, twitter, etsy!, trader joes, interactive media, innovation, imported cars, ancient civilizations, good teachers  i am optimistic, quirky, and fun-loving"

85,"like everyone else on this site, i feel awkward trying to sum myself up in a box for the sake of strangers on the internet. now that we've got that out of the way i was born in calgary, spent most of my childhood around the d.c. area, and came out to sunny california for school. i am a funny, loyal, patient, cynical, laid-back dreamer, something of a hopeless romantic. i'm a big believer in finding the humor in everyday life and compulsively crack wise about the ridiculous things i see in advertisements, politics, restaurant menus, etc. and also squirrels. squirrels get up to some funny shit. i love to read and can easily spend hours in a good bookstore. i'm a huge cinephile and in the right mood can enjoy a bad movie every bit as much as a good one  see my aforementioned enjoyment of the ridiculous. i'm a fan of hugs and backrubs  giving or getting. i strongly support women's rights and gay rights and all other forms of social equality. if you don't, we might not get along so well. just sayin'. i love music but i also appreciate a good stretch of silence every now and then. i love collecting information about how things work and can happily geek out over some obscure facet of biology, physics, psychology, history, or anthropology. i enjoy the outdoors even though i don't get out as often as i'd like to, especially foresty areas. there's something comforting about trees. i don't believe in astrology, which means i have no explanation for why almost everything i read about scorpios matches me dead-on."
86,"welcome to my profile, your search is now over.  i love mountain biking, sketching in nature, urban hikes, camping, climbing, yoga classes, getting really hungry and then eating, cyclocross, bike touring and spending time with friends doing those things (some of those things are not nearly as fun to do alone)"
87,"i'm an introvert who sometimes leads an extrovert's life. i like going out and getting crazy over some karaoke and liquor as much as the next person, but sometimes my couch and my xbox are my bffs.  i've been living in the bay area for about eight years, and i haven't been able to get myself to leave. i moved to san francisco about a year ago, and so far, so good."
88,i don't have much to say. i'm an old school kid of guy that strongly believes that two people should express and learn about eachother face to face. that is what is exciting about dating and love is discovering one another.
89,"i'm a pisces, odd because i'm allergic to fish. maybe you think all that horiscope stuff is bullshit, but hey...this is a dating website and i couldn't help but referencing something so cliche! in general my outlook on life is that you should be kind to other people and when you find people you care about, you should prove it to them. also life should be fun, and when possible, include great wine."

95,"i'm new to sf from boston and thought this might be a good way to meet some new people.  instead of writing about me i think it would be better if i told you what i am looking for,  while i am always down to meet new friends, i know what i want in a girl, and i don't want to waste your time.  you enjoy ordering something different everytime you go out to a restaurant, and speaking of restaurants, offering to split the check on the first date tells a lot more about a person than someone who assumes its taken care of, even though i will never let you do that.  i am tall. i like tall girls. 5'6"" to 6'2 is the sexy sweet zone.  if you can ski or snowboard and know what state jackson hole is in you pretty much beat everyone out. i'll date a non skier but don;t expect me to hang out with you on a powder day.  adventures are fun, but so is being lazy. i like doing new things, just not all the time.  my mother taught me how to cook, which she is great at, i will at some point make you cook with me. its ok if you don't know how. its not ok if you don't try.  dr. pepper is the best soda, don't hate if you can't appreciate.  owning a gym membership is a good thing.  no hiding secret talents, if you can do amazing things i want to see it.  people who use the number 3 instead of the e are stupid.  and most importantly, you are not dateable if you sleep with someone on the first night."

100,"a friend suggested i try out this online thing just to see what it's like. i will let you know i feel totally weird doing this and it even feels a bit creepy. but what the hell its 2012, right? ok here goes... i grew up a humble country-boy in the rolling fields of central massachusetts, riding my bike and playing in the woods. i went to umass amherst, then moved to boston, where i was landscape architect and park planner for the national park service. i left that dream job to become a full-time musician (drums) and bandleader for a few years. i left that dream job to move to sf, got my teaching credential at university of san francisco and am wrapping up my masters there. currently i'm teaching high school science at a public charter here in san francisco, and loving it. another dream job. within those years are innumerable adventures, countless friends, lost loves, hit and misses and many proverbial roller coaster rides. but i can tell you more about that if we ever meet."
101,"from san diego to the bay six years ago. gave up the sun, the beach, and the mexican food for the fog, the cold beach, and burritos with rice and beans wrapped in foil (which i am still getting used to.....okay, farolito is pretty damn good). i still have that hakuna matata mentality - i never sweat the small stuff......brah.  i'm not a very serious person (unless i need to be). i joke and laugh a lot, and people think i'm always happy-go-lucky. in reality, i'm extremely depressed, on six types of mental medication, and i have a service animal for companionship. just kidding. see, i told you.  i would like to think of myself as an extremely patient and calm person. i find a sense of accomplishment in being able to balance those who aren't.  i don't believe in the art of profile-making, and i think meeting someone in person is the only way to go. we're not all salespeople, and i'm glad."
102,"i'm on a temporary hiatus from trying to define myself, particularly in concise blurbs. however, i'm finding this reluctance to summarize just might be adversely affecting my socio-economic success levels.  if you found the blurb above to be a) wordy, b) confusing, or c) wholly devoid of humor and irony, then you'll most likely find me annoying."
103,"have been in sf for a couple of years for business... and very pleased to call it home now. no intentions to head back home to australia anytime soon, as there's just so much to do here and so many interesting people to meet."
104,"i am an energetic extrovert, cheerful and happy almost all of the time, with a good dose of east coast snarkyness thrown in. i have a lot of genuine enthusiasm about a lot of things. i pack a big punch for such a little person.  i thrive on meeting new people and experiencing new things, but also at times seek comfort in the familiar to recharge. i'm an open person- counter to my wasp-y pedigree, i am good at communicating (when i want to be) and and it is important to me to cultivate openness in relationships as well.  i am equally at home in the city as i am in the woods, and need a healthy balance of both to survive. city conveniences that i most rely on include good coffee, microbrews, ethnic food and, you know, culture. but i also need to step outside and leave my iphone behind for extended periods of time to remember what truly matters.  i'm from the northeast (maine) and frequently contemplate returning to that corner of the world to live at some point. i totally love it here (who doesn't?!), but there's just a certain pull to the pine forests and rolling green mountains and granite coastline of my home state that i don't think i'll able to ignore forever.  i am a summer camp kid. i love to climb. i drive a station wagon for adventures, and ride my bike the rest of the time. i can ski like a banshee. i want to someday grow some of my own food-- specifically, concord grapes."
105,"i love movies, theater, and exercise. i try to keep fit and healthy and love new challenges, whether it's a run around the dish or a sport i've never tried. i love european football and have been known to miss work for a crucial match. my kids and family are very important to me and i spend a lot of time with them. i love to travel, have lived abroad several times and would love to do it again. i am also passionate about food; anything really, but especially chocolate. i have an open mind for alternate opinions and am always looking for new opportunities to challenge my mind."
106,"i'm a glass-half-full kind of girl, am emotionally wired to be very logical, and abhor drama. i'm eternally curious and work in left-brain things, but enjoy right-brain activities much more .... drawing or creating things. i over-analyze everything, so almost never regret my actions. i always have a point of view, but only share with those who can agree to disagree. i love food... its preparation, presentation, taste, culture, history. i love wind, snow, and water whipping across my face. i watch cnn and read the ny times more than the local news. i love thought-provoking forms of art and expression.  i prefer to be direct, the east coast influence i suppose. you can ask me anything and i will give you a direct answer. i don't play games, except the occasional board or video type. but due to lots of corporate feedback, early adulthood on capitol hill, and friends worldwide, i've learned to be much more circumspect about how my words/actions will be perceived. although when my team is being attacked repeatedly, all bets are off :-p. controlling my temper and extreme diplomacy are learned skills, so i remain constantly vigilant.  i am a mix of cultures, having been born into one, raised in another, and sought others in adulthood. i'm the older of 2 and have 3 nieces, whom i adore. i work to live well. i exercise, so that i can indulge. i need quiet time to recharge, but have a large circle of friends/relatives worldwide with whom i've kept in touch for decades. i try to live like the song, ""i hope you dance"" and the poem instantes by borges."
107,"hi, im sean, so these sites are always a wired experience. obviously were here because its free, and well were here to meet people, so feel free to shoot me a message if you want, thats why were here right? but im still going to school as of now, im working as a medic right now( i have lots of crazy story's if you wana hear them) and am eather going straight to med school or go into business to take over my fathers business. well see what happens, hope to hear from you soon!"
108,"i pride myself on having fun no matter where i am or what i'm doing. i smile a lot and i have a tendency to laugh at inappropriate times. i love the law but hated law school. brunch is my favorite meal. i bleed blue and gold. maker's and ginger ale is my beverage of choice. every once in a while i still find myself amazed when i realize that i'm lucky enough to live in san francisco. i speak in superlatives and hyperbole constantly (see what i did there?). i know my age up there says i'm 28, but sometimes i could swear that i'm still 16 and i'm just playing pretend at this whole ""grownup/lawyer/responsible person"" business."
109,"i graduated with a bs and now have a full time career in san francisco, but i live in the east bay with two roommates. i enjoy watching hockey, baseball, and football (probably in that order too). i'm a fan of the outdoors; mostly backpacking, but dabble in other activities. i love to travel, fly, and am huge into motorcycles.  i'm on this site because i don't have much free time or the avenues of meeting people. i'm a born again christian and my faith is very important to me. i won't end up with anybody who doesn't understand who christ is and trust in him alone for salvation. i do, however, realize life isn't always about where you've been but where you're going. where you're going is what's important to me. and i realize, of course, that nobody is perfect; i'll be the first to tell you i'm not!"
110,"i grew up in seattle and mexico city and therefore enjoy both outdoor activities and city life. this upbringing fuels my love of travel (costa rica most recently) and for food and wines from around the world. i grew up with a wonderful family of artists and teachers so i have a passion for learning and all things creative.  professionally, i work in the area of international and public affairs. i started my career as a political speechwriter in d.c. and have since focused on starting educational programs and fundraising for charitable organizations. helping others and being active in the community are important values and i set ambitious goals for myself in these areas. in this regard, i'm looking for a woman who is similarly driven, and wants to make the world a better place.  my idea of heaven is sitting at a sidewalk cafe on a warm summer evening sharing great food, wine and conversation with a woman i adore. i love spending time with family (my sister is one of my closest friends) and i appreciate making friends everywhere i go. i'm looking for a partner who also likes being social and finds positive qualities in others.  i enjoy long distance running, tennis, yoga and most team sports. i play on a kickball team during the summer. i also spend my time going to watch music and live theater. i'm a big fan of discovering and supporting local musicians, and artist. some of my hobbies include playing music, salsa dancing and photography.  i'm looking for an attractive, confident woman who loves great conversation, being active and sampling cuisine from all over the world. a positive person who enjoys learning and always sees the glass as  full. bonus points for artistic use of sarcasm and the curiosity to try new things."

113,"hey i'm angel, here's a little about myself. i am a born an raised californian, whoo. been in the bay area for a while now. i'm a bit of a tomboy. i love video games, football (go niners), hiking, that kinda stuff. got to love the earth, so i try to stay conscious about how i effect the world and other people in it. i'm into politics too , although i dont know a bunch about them but i try to learn more. a proud obama supporter and democrat, of course.  i'm a fan of nature, music, fishing, bicycling, movies, art, good books, kid stuff and finding new things to get into. i'm goin to school to become a chef, i love everything about food so it was a given for me. i'm not what you say ""religous"" so i'm into men with a mind for discovering other things. i've found that i need a guy that is spiritual or its not really a good match.  i'm working on goals right now, just moved to san francisco and getting into school. i'm a happy person, down to earth and have great sense of humor, just trying to find a guy that can handle me. i'm an intellectual and very open minded. i'm into guys who have sense, home training and knows how to treat a lady. i like men that like to look nice and has a mind. happy hunting ;-)"

118,"single, white, female.  ok, ok...  it seems as though the virtual representation of a person always includes: hiking, painting, reading to the blind, impressively active and productive activities ad nauseum. if that were the truth, i would probably see more than five people on lengthy hikes and not nearly as many people switching between twitter and craigslist's missed connections on their laptops at every coffee shop i've ever been to, ever--just sayin'.  in order to combat this trend, how about i just write about what i did this past week? i began and finished two paintings, drew a bunch, ate some chocolate form germany and czech republic, worked a bunch, missed a lot of sleep, got sick, went to the bank, and cleaned the bathtub. nothing too out of line and i got some important stuff in! bam!  also, my laptop began having a problem, so i'm not being rude by not replying to your messages; i'm just not able to (or best excuse ever?)."

128,"although i don't live here yet i am moving to sf before 7/2012. since i only know all of two people in this city i would be cool to meet some new people.  i am no good at describing myself. i like anything fun, going out to shows/bars/restaurants, traveling to far away countries, getting into squirt gun fights with strangers, the usual you know. beer nerd/computer geek is how i describe myself."
129,"i love ridiculously impractical projects including cryocoolers, electric bicycles, lasers, polaroid cameras, and world domination plans. i also write software.  unfortunately this does not leave much time for profile editing.

155,"""it is terrible to have to ask for anything ever. we wish we were something that needed nothing, like paint. but even paint needs repainting."" -miranda july.  these things always seem to put so much pressure on really narrowing yourself down to a particular way. it really makes you think about how you view yourself & how you want others to view you. you cross your fingers & hope that they are the same. i feel like i am a very easy going person, but that doesn't mean i don't know what i want. i think reading in bed is sexy, so is humility & a charming awkwardness. i like to think that i am a very deep person who thinks a lot about a lot of things. i love people, & learning any kind of new skill. i read all the time. i love libraries & the smell of books. i also like art, live shows, queer open mic & nerdy/funny girls who can match my cleverness....  i'm honest. i'm loyal. i'm creative. i'm awkward in a charming way. i like when life hands me ironic situations (keeps things interesting) oh & i like to laugh.... a lot (who doesn't?) i also hate people who do not know that ""a lot"" is 2 words = pet peeve. i am super social & love to people watch. i've never known a stranger. i am notorious for starting random conversations with random people in random places. i am a logical romantic."
156,"i put god first, family and friends and enjoy seeking fun activities for the weekends with my son and friends. sharing good times and smiles are a must for me. of course there is always worship twice a week and i have been a volunteer at a local animal shelter for nine years. mother, office manager, real estate investor, screenwriter and author. i enjoy seeing stand-up comedy, plays, movies and outdoor activities. friendship is a necessary factor in a good relationship; to establish this requires openness and effective communication. quality time to learn and truly understand a person is paramount."
157,"i grew up on the east coast and moved to the bay area for grad school. before california, i lived in south america for three years teaching about the environment. this means that giant bugs don't really bother me anymore, i have a deep appreciation for washing machines, and i like to drink yerba mate when i'm feeling nostalgic - but only with a bombilla.  i know everyone says this, but i like to travel -- a lot. i've been to all 50 states and i've filled up two passports. there are still countless places i want to visit - it seems that i just need to fly increasingly far to get to them. generally, i'm drawn to people who are also curious about the world. bonus points if you've lived outside of the us for any stretch of time.  i think this is one of those fake quotes, attributable to no one, but i really like it nonetheless: ""every morning i wake up torn between a desire to improve the world and an inclination to savor it. this makes it hard to plan the day."""
158,"i would describe myself as a friendly, down to earth person. i am kind, caring, loyal to my friends and family."
159,
160,"i enjoy the outdoors, theatre, fine dining and films. i like trying new things, redecorating, dealing with color, reading, meeting people. i am looking for companionship, havefun times and share that with someone. i would love to travel and see and experience different cultures"
161,"at the moment, i am opening my self to all the possibilities out there. i like meeting fun and interesting people, and i am usually up for trying something new at least once!"
162,just your average guy with a crazy story wanting to expand my network and meet some cool new people.
163,"i'm basically a fun / nice / funny chick who loves exploring, hanging out/getting into and out of trouble with friends, writing, reading, gardening, tennis, guitar, stimulating conversations, pets, plants, cooking/eating, and listening to live music.  my last several trips have included nepal, peru, kenya, iran, spain, lebanon, uk, turkey, iran, taiwan, ecuador, and belize. lately i'm digging exploring the bay area (lake berryessa, healdsburg, inverness, gualala) and little unknown parts of the city. i'm finding out that you don't need to go far to have an adventure, and i'm loving that feeling :)  i have a full and fun life, and while i'm comfortable being alone, i absolutely adore being in a connected relationship. i love long stimulating conversations, fabulous meals, physical intimacy, road trips, romance, and just all-around fun/teasing/joking/laughs with my partner. i'm attracted to guys who are open-minded, fun, smart in a real-world way (formal education doesn't matter so much...), happy, caring, and having an optimistic outlook on life and the world (a lot of us have been through rough stuff... it's how you let that shape you and what you choose to do with it moving forward that matters)."
164,
165,
166,"i pretty much cannot be bothered to fill out most of this, but will say that i am fun, warm, funny, active yet lazy, and curious."
167,"i am strong woman who loves to dance (even though i'm not the greatest at it), loves her family, and loves life. i am a little bit of a dreamer, but i know how to get serious when it counts to get things done. i teach youth, work at a solar company, and attend uc berkeley. i love working with my community whether if its in the bay area or on campus. my long term goal is to get involved with community youth development programs and have as many experiences as i can. life is too short to not enjoy it."
168,"i recently moved to san francisco from london with my work (it's a hard life!). i am interested in loads of different things, but my main passions are probably sailing, reading and music. i'm not sure what i'm looking for relationship-wise but would love to go for a drink or something and meet some new people."
169,"i'm off traveling for the rest of may. if you write, i'll be sure to respond in june. thanks!  i like to read (books, magazines, online-- you name it), travel, eat, and be outdoors."
170,"hi im jess i moved to sf a couple of months ago. im here to date and to hopefully find a meaningful relationship, not to mess around(just to give you a heads up)!i go to fidm im a fashion design major. im here to meet real genuine guys. im loads and fun but quiet at first and love to have a good time. im a total romantic and really am looking for someone special. as you can also see am very scatter brained i have so much i want to say i just mix it up sometimes.lets talk and see were things go from there."
171,"my ongoing primary interest is simply to enjoy my very limited free time with friends (you?) when i'm not working or studying. get in touch if this commitment to my independence works for you. i still make the same great friend as ever and if you're interested in me without the romance and willing to accept my limited availability then i'm open to you and the great unknown. doods included-- but i find it weird to say i'm 'interested in everyone'- i don't roll like that, homie- so i'm not switching that option. but really, a few of you should wanna hang."
172,"i am looking for a mutually fulfilling, fun relationship with long term potential. because i am a partner in our venture capital fund i have some flexibility in my hours, allowing time for personal travel.  i have three great sons who are now in college (east coast), working in a startup (bay area), and working in a multinational firm (russia). i get along with each of them very well; occasionally they even call to ask for advice (!). i admit that my one-on-one basketball games with each of them changed character dramatically when they grew from, say, 5-8, to 6-4 (where all three ended up). it is a serious problem to give away 3 inches in height and three decades in age in a basketball game. although i rarely beat any of them anymore, i do give them a workout. more importantly, it encourages conversations that may not necessarily occur in other settings, resulting in my doing a better job as a father.  my golf game has improved over the last couple of years, and i can see a path to it getting even better.  it is not easy to predict the qualities a good match for me would have, but it's great if you are outgoing, authentic, and active. i like children, so if you have kids that is a positive in my view. i enjoy spending time with my sons when they visit. a very important but hard to characterize criteria may best be described as mutual chemistry. meeting for coffee is probably needed to see how that works out for both sides.  i can see taking you to movies, hiking or otherwise exercising together, going dancing, trying out local restaurants for dinner, going to concerts, taking weekend trips to a variety of destinations, and also just relaxing.  my photos are very accurate. all were taken within the last two years except for the photo with two of my sons and my dad, which was taken in 2008."
173,"""i love people who make me laugh. i honestly think it's the thing i like most, to laugh. it cures a multitude of ills. it's probably the most important thing in a person.""  audrey hepburn said that, and that pretty much sums it up.  but i'll write more because this is about me and not audrey hepburn. i was born in la, went to college in santa cruz, and have lived in the city for six years now and it's the longest i've ever lived anywhere. i work in a tall skyscraper editing online news by day, which tends to drive me to more creative pursuits in my off hours. i'm a comedy and music nerd, and my favorite festivals right now are the pickathon and the sf sketch fest. the only thing that i've had a fanatical obsession with is twin peaks. i have actually been to the great northern, met the one-armed man, and eaten the cherry pie.  a recent obsession: getting juiced. as in, taking advantage of my housemate's newly acquired juicer to get what she has dubbed a ""hot beet injection."" before that, i was drinking way too much fancy coffee from sightglass and bluebottle and became a nervous wreck throughout the morning...i save that for the weekend now when i wanna get real crazy.  in general, i'd say i'm a fairly independent person and not prone to serial monogamy, but, since i'm not going anywhere in the foreseeable future, it would be nice to have someone to take weekend trips with and share all the excitement i have for said nerd-isms...or just stay in with and help me watch more of the criterion collection.  "
174,"when you first see me i look like a tough guy but after you get to know me you will find out that im a nice, funny, sexy guy lol!"
175,
176,"i'm a pretty laid back guy, currently work full time as a sales engineer at a small tech startup in sf. my job is pretty amazing as i have a lot of variety in my day to day activities, and i get to travel from time to time as well. i love being outdoors and being very active, although if i'm with the right person, i don't really care what i am doing i will be enjoying myself and will make sure that they are too.  outside of the 9-5 grind, my hobbies include playing hockey, hanging out with friends, traveling, cooking (poorly), hiking, and going to shows. i'm a pretty sarcastic person, and definitely click with people that have a good sense of humor and are not overly sensitive."
177,"you might be wondering why my profile name is such that it is. well i love burrito's...all kinds of burrito's. cheesy, lamb filled, veal filled, duck filled..whatever, i don't care. just give me a god damn burrito. seriously though, i love food. only when it's in my mouth. i don't like cooking. what a waste of time. so if you like cooking and eating, you're the gal for me.  now let me tell you what i hate. vegetarians and vegans, that's what. she might be the hottest thing since marilyn monroe on a cow, but if she won't put said cow in her mouth (after it is properly cooked, of course), then she can ride said cow into said sunset.  so, how do i make my money, you might be wondering, to pay for all this tasty tasty food?? one word...murals. google that shit if you don't know what it is...actually, if you don't know stop reading this immediately and find some yourself a joe shmoe because i ain't no joe shmoe. so, i paint murals. where do you need a mural? your bedroom, a public bathroom, a church, the inside of your dogs house? no problem...i'll paint it. i went to school for zoo keeping (zoology for you fancy folks out there), but ended up painting murals. what can i say...when muhammad gives you a gift, you gotta run with it. (thanks, muhammad. thanks a whole hell of a lot.)  now, onto the things i like to do for fun. this is the paragraph where i'm supposed to tell you about all the obscure music and movies that neither you nor i have never heard of. so let's skip that bullshit and cut right to the chase: i like to eat food, drink beer, and listen to really popular music that everyone knows. every now and then, i like to watch a movie (or a ""film,"" for all of you uptight hipsters that i don't want to meet anyway). i also think my little pony is a great way to pass time on a saturday afternoon.  the end"
178,"i am a fun loving person who can take care of business. known for being open minded, supportive and always up for a great adventure. my social and work lives keep me pretty busy, but always open to meeting/hanging out with new people.  brand new to the online dating experience, but thought i would give it a shot since a lot of my friends seem to be having fun with it."
179,"east bay native, big-time nerd, highly analytical. hedonistic tendencies.  i am a expert in the fields of cognitive dissonance, language and computer programming. i'm scuba certified, a startup co-founder, open source contributor and probably the most laid-back person of all time."
180,"going by what i'm told you will find i'm a rather strong person with an open mind. as for what i think about myself, i'm more empathetic and adventurous than average. i'm on here because i believe there is a chance if i put myself out there then i might be lucky enough to someday share my life with someone very special."
181,i like to hangout with my friends. i'm a bookworm! and i love to laugh and make other people laugh.
182,"im from northbay, but lived in sd for a decade and consider myself a socal kind of kid. i love warm weather, going outside and exploring. meeting new people and letting each day lead me in a new direction. i like to have fun, its important in my life, i joke around, a lot and expect you to be able to take a joke. im sarcastic and witty and hope you can be just as humorous back at me."
183,"hey ... i am a healthy guy and with health everything is possible. i love to run, workout and hike, which i do all regularly, i am into other physical activities as well. i love to just hang out and be spontaneous."
184,just a laid back guy hoping to meet some really nice ladies :)
185,"i fall into the smart is sexy category of women. i've got my act together (great house, great kid, great friends, great job) and have done my laundry consistently over the years. i grew up on the east coast and am drawn to smart, musical, creative, thoughtful people with big hearts. i have wonderful friends, a meaningful career and i adopted my five year old daughter from ethiopia two years ago and just love being her mom. she's the best thing that has ever happened to me. i grow veggies in my backyard, enjoy tinkering at art/house projects and getting out for a hike or exploring different restaurants and music venues."
186,
187,"well, i really like wine and cheese. this is an awkward paragraph to write and that's the first sentence i came up with - this being the second. there's just something about sitting outside with friends drinking wine, eating delicious food (i.e. - cheese) and talking that's amazing. i also love sports - even basketball and volleyball where my height obviously places me at a huge disadvantage to do anything beneficial for the team. i think it's the camaraderie, the teamwork and the activity all rolled into one that i love. i even like going to sporting events like football and baseball games. i probably won't watch any of the game (especially baseball as that is the most boring sport on the planet) but i'll socialize with everyone there and stand up when people cheer. i love my family and friends, i'm passionate about my work, and in general i really enjoy life."
188,i'm silly. i'm analytical. i'm fond of short sentences.
189,"tom is tall. tom is funny. tom is creative and bright. tom is loyal, dependable, and loving. tom has a good job (that drives him crazy). tom will not cheat on you. tom can be real quiet at times but don't let that freak you out, it's just his way. tom works at a tv station and plays bass in a rock band. tom doesn't have a lot of free time so he's throwing himself up on the internet to see if he can meet someone special to share his life with."
190,"things i really like: sitting in my backyard, drinking sunday morning tea, reading after a long day of work, learning new things, writing mostly pointless e-mails to my sister and brother-in-law, listening to ira glass's voice, laughing at puns, running (slowly, for now), dancing with much brio if not skill, and watching desert skies  i adopt new hobbies often. most recently, this has been banjo playing and quilt making. i am thinking of getting into butter churning to complete a 'little house on the prairie'-esque trifecta.  i was born and raised in ohio, and i think i will always be a midwesterner at heart."
191,"i was born and raised in socal but moved up to the bay area for school and just kind of stuck around. i love it in socal but the bay just grew on me, haha. i am a visual fx artist, currently working for dreamworks animation..... no not pixar, and not toy story 3, haha.  i'm generally a positive, good humored guy. i try to be as athletic as possible. enjoy taking some swings at the batting cages, snowboarding, wake boarding.  send me a message if you want to know more, i'll try to respond though i sometimes forget to check my messages here, so sorry in advance if you don't hear back from me right away =)"
192,"hey! my name is michele, people also call me pirate. im a 29 year old hairdresser and i'm extremely passionate about what i do :) i love to go out and have a good time, go get lost in nature or just lay around the house. and i'm always looking for company :)"
193,"oh hey what is this over here, the internet? are we on the internet today? that's what we're gonna do?  that's nice, let us internet properly and responsibly. with vim and vigor!!  beep beep! websites!  this is dating.  i am looking for a partner in crime so that we can go rob a bank and maybe murder some people. seriously, why do people keep looking for partners in crime? are you all crooks in here? where is the law abiding dating web site?"
194,"born and raised in rural missouri and educated in boston and baltimore, i love both open spaces and urban places. i don't speak with a twang anymore except when i go back home (it's not intentional, i swear). i have an unusually high tolerance (perhaps even an appreciation) for country music, but my itunes collection spans the musical spectrum. i am politically liberal and my high school classmate's fb postings sometimes make me cringe, but i understand they are good people too. i am a huge fan of rei, but i avoid shopping at wal-mart having seen what it can do to a small town's economy. and while i prefer to take my subaru down dirt roads, i've learned to love the challenge of squeezing it into the only available parallel parking space.  i moved to the bay area nine years ago to start my first real job, if you don't count my high school summer as a grill boy at mcdonald's. when i'm not mentoring graduate students in the lab or teaching them in the classroom, i enjoy the outdoorshiking, biking, fly fishing, skiing, or just hanging out with my dog. i love watching films, going to concerts or plays, keeping fit by running road races (sixteen half-marathons so far), enjoy good food/wine, and cherish good conversation. i try to read as much as i can, though sometimes those best intentions can be limited to a quick excursion through the new yorker and whatever is on display in the grocery store aisle. and now that i've been handed down my sister's roland, i've been brushing up my piano playing. i also like to cook (for others, not especially for myself)."
195,
196,"okay, so i know you checked out my pictures and you're back for more. great. i'm going to take the dog for a walk while you find out a little more about me here. enjoy, and shoot me a message or wink or whatever when you're done so we can get to know each other. want to laugh out loud? come, meet me. my jokes will set you rolling on the floor. my eyes and my legs make me stand out. what follows in the list is my smile that can set everything, even your mood."
197,"a good friend of mine actually wrote this, i hate writing about myself. what can i say i'm way more interested in other people & would rather talk about you! i am happy with my life. i enjoy my job & travel every chance i get. i have an amazing family (in boston so they won't be barging in unexpectedly) & i'm a lucky aunt to 2 nieces & nephew who i would do absolutely anything for. i'm thankful for incredible friends who love me for all my faults (not that i have too many) & idiosyncrasies. in the last 6 weeks i have traveled to belize, martha's vineyard, tx, hi, tn & in. my friends tease me that i am george clooney from up in the air. it's true, i value my miles & my passport more than any other possession. i'm activesoccer, spinning, scuba diving, taking walksyou name it. i'm one of those people who get up @ 5:30am to workout, even when i travel (and a hangover). but it's nice when the instructor knows to expect you & saves you a bike! if i have an addiction problem, it's definitely to endorphins. and red wine too. i love doing long city hikes and exploring new restaurants & hot spots, and i'm rather passionate about real estate. i enjoy sunday open houses just for fun. i can't explain it! but if you're looking for company to go house-hunting, i'm definitely your girl. i love to keep busy but enjoy my quiet time too. i'm looking for a partner-in-crime. i will challenge you and make you laugh all at the same time. i'm about to book my next flight, are you in?"

201,"socially awkward but if you give me a few drinks i think we'll have a few good laugh. i hate to read profiles that feels like it have been copied and paste, either that or i've read one too many of the same ones. i recently joined the meet-up crew and going to try a few mixer or running group to hopefully meet some new faces/friends/fate not pushing myself but trying is a pretty good start.  let's start off with a hi how are you. i really don't expect you to read my whole profile but if you got this far.... kudos and a hand clap to you."
202,"i like meeting new people to have adventures and great conversations with. i love to learn - what can you teach me?  i over-use parentheses and semicolons.  i am daydreamy, academic, and outdoorsy"
203,"originally from the east bay, plan on staying, though i've really enjoyed my short forays living on the east coast. i love traveling - have mostly done international but my next big dream trip would be to take a small rv (or tear-drop trailer, seen the april/may sunset cover?!) all over the us...unfortunately i don't have the time or money yet... my apartment is super clean, my car is super messy. i love fish, farmers markets, gin, and bourbon. i feel weird if a week goes by and i haven't done a long hike in tilden or muir woods... both old-school hip hop and a good country song get me going (de la, tribe, and whoever sings ""tequila makes her clothes come off""). i hate puzzles... and surprises."
204,"i'm from mexico live in san francisco 6 years ago , graduated from cordon bleu ..my self : i look serious but after you take the risk . you'll find out the fun girl i'm but you can not tell just with my appearance , i'm not easy, but interesting girl , looking for some one who appreciated , cheering good moments , good food , relax time , who is a hard working , love to be with family and friends !! a good person , with good manor , a gentlemen , some one who makes me feel save ;)"
205,"i'm a writer. i do other stuff for a paycheck, but i'm a writer. i didn't figure that out until a few years ago, so when i say it, i'm telling both of us. people read what i write. some like it. it amazes me. i hope it always does.  other things about me: i am sort of obsessed with monks and competitive cooking shows. not really obsessed, but if there were a television show in which monks cooked competitively, i'd be all in.  my favorite smells are cucumbers, toast and wet pavement. i am an excellent car singer. i'm not into conspicuous consumption, but i do like boots.  i am a fan of pinball, coffee, certain fonts and carmex. i love pedicures and brunch but have both rarely to keep them special.  i don't wash my car as often as i should.  i prefer spontaneity to plans. if i make plans, i will keep them. i am always learning something. i'm learning how to cook and am doing some research for the novel i just started. i would love to learn how to surf. i would look ridiculous doing so. i don't care. it looks like fun.  i'm not crazy about chain restaurants or the word literally.  i have a six foot memory foam beanbag. it is awesome."
206,"i am a born and raised socal venice beach boy, moved up to sf 6 years ago for work and i never looked back. when i was younger i spent time exploring europe, camped around america..... i don't understand why i am i finding filling this self summary so difficult as i can schmooze with the best of them. kinda crazy trying to condense 43 years of being on this earth in one paragraph i'm definitely a jeans and t-shirt kinda guy, i do love going anywhere that requires me to get a new a zoot suit. way more city guy, less country (although i do have a great appreciation for it) i am straightforward for good or ill (blunt & tactless, but very honest). i will gladly be the one to talk about the elephant in the room. i'm blindly loyal and very protective of loved ones, have been accused of being old fashioned (thanks dad). my grammar is shit, i'm very funny.. i crack myself up, hopefully you will to. i am a die hard fan of the mission, i don't have a car, it didn't take long for me to realize schlepping around the city in a car blow's, now i only ride my motorcycle."
207,"spontaneous, loving, driven, artistic, witty, etc"
208,"i think we are all on missions, and mine included traveling. it's best for both of us that you have too, inside yourself or outside--either way, the journey is important and i'd love to hear about yours.  i love being active, and like the idea of spontaneous adventures, having ideas and manifesting them, in the moment or thinking long term. whatever, but i like to live with possibility and the belief that i have what i want. don't get me wrong- it is a real carving to really know what we want.  i need someone who knows how to laugh and loves a good heated debate, while also knowing when to stop and make sure love is what is being bred. i sometimes need a big hug at the end of my day, or a hot bath.  i want a passionate soul who can speak up for what they believe in and will defend my sweetness instead of insult it. i need a man who loves nature and will pull me aside and knows how to get what he wants.  i have wonderful friends there and feel most myself in the woods and near the ocean. i love working, helping people and believe i massage the tensions that could create more world peace. i meditate for the same reason, make sure i am clear and not holding grudges or resentments, and am good and getting through misunderstandings and ending with love and laughter. i do my job well and live what i teach."
209,"i'm me. what more do you want? like pretty much everyone else, i hate these boxes. i can not be adequately summed up in boxes. but i guess i can try :) i'm kind of a dork/nerd. i enjoy reading, knitting, watching movies, and hanging out with my pets. i enjoy watching sports, but not playing. my favorites are (sharks) hockey and football. i'm always down for a good cup of tea. i love the beach and hiking. i'm fiercely loyal to my friends and family. i love my family and we're all pretty close, so i try to spend as much time with them as possible :d i consider my pets family. i am human mom to a dog, cat, lizard, and snake. my eyes are blue, my hair changes colour on a decently regular basis, i prefer british spelling, i dislike using proper capitalization and occasionally i get creative with punctuation as well. i am capable of using proper grammar, but usually prefer to not bother with it. i am a fan of using some of the ""i can has"" type grammar, but it annoys me if it is done to excess. i am endothermic and very much appreciate blankets and warm animals or people who will snuggle and donate some of their warmth to me. i may or may not have a sock problem. that depends entirely on your definition of ""problem."" it have two piercings in each earlobe with every intention of adding more. i once said that i would never have a facial piercing but i got my nose pierced and it's definitely my favorite. i have two tattoos with every intention of adding more as time, money and body space permit."

211,"i was on my way to los angeles from portland, but landed in san francisco. it's too cold, so i'm heading to san diego next week.  update: i'm back in san francisco. i can't seem to get away."
212,"really, what's the point of this summary? i don't think anyone actually reads this part. you just look at the pictures and either; a) move on if you don't think i'm cute enough or b) you read my email and return my message only after viewing my pics to see if i'm cute enough...come on, you know that's the truth!  this is why guys generally don't put in the effort online because it goes nowhere. sure, i could talk about how funny i am, how smart i am, how i have an amazing little boy who has truly taught me about unconditional love, how i go running in gg to clear my mind, eat at hole in the wall places, how i come up with a new get rich scheme every few days (obviously i'm still trying to find the one). i could get into all the ways you would be lucky to have a guy like me...but you don't care about any of that. its all about the pics.  because i always forget...arrogance is a new trait among so many on this site, that you look down on guys, that because you think your so pretty and wear nice clothes, you deserve some gq looking guy. oh, and if you thought i was cute and actually read to this point...high five! what i just wrote was a test to see if girls actually read profiles or not, and if you don't think i'm cute but read this far, well...i tricked you ;), and i probably wasn't that interested in you anyways. yes, i agree the above equally applies to guys. in fact, guys are worse...and yes this was meant to be slightly truthful/humorous since most of us go to pictures, make a + or - decision, then read the profile...i'm really looking forward to seeing what kind of hate mail i'm going to get. i'll of course keep you updated."
213,"this might make it a little less random.... i had been together with a woman for almost 6 years until a year ago and i met her about a year after being married for 10 years. any kind of person might be the right one for me. who knows? i am more mature now, but was a bit of a peter pan. worked as a lawyer for years, before joining the peace corps, working for the courts and going back to working at law firms. i then practiced in my own small firm, and tried to make time for my kids, now 18 and 15, before they grew up, but have melded back into firm life. i have my son at my house 1/2 time, but the rest of the week i am free to be wherever and have fun and adult conversation. i like a lot of things but they are not all essential: music, movies, dancing (swing, rock, zydeco...), hikes in the hills or woods. i care deeply about politics and the world, although there is much to be cynical about these days and it is hard to listen to the news. i'm more of a ""night"" person. i can sometime be watching charlie rose after midnight. but i don't mind an early person. it's hard to say who would be a match - a very unlikely person could have a matching heart."
214,"hey! so i've lived in the novato area for the past 2 years i'm originally from carlow, ireland. i've been in the states for the past 4 years and this is where i've settled for now - life's pretty grand ain't it? i'm an artist by trade mainly do water coloring and some mural work. i'm seeking new friends and connections and am open to whatever else manifests. being outdoors is a huge part of my life so someone who is open to exploring with me would be ideal. someone who is also artistic or supportive of my art would be wonderful."
215,"i'm a relatively conservative, professional guy. i love the winter more than the summer, and i love to do stuff outdoors. i'm looking for companionship, friendship, and a relationship.  i love to travel, play sports, stay very busy, and spend time with friends and family. i have interests in politics, religion, cars, sports, all the guy-stuff.... i hope you do too :)"
216,"great running order, new tires and good brakes. smogged through 2011. the paint is in decent shape and the engine is tip top. the upholstery may need to be replaced..."
217,"im a midwestern woman who has lived all over the country and ended up on the west coast. i am a newly single mother of two beautiful little girls who i spend half of my time with. i am super social, pretty athletic, and always love a good cocktail party. oh and if you are wondering, i am east indian. everyone who meets me says ""you're indian? half indian right? and half what else?"" no, i'm 100% indian, i dont know why i always get that, but i always do. im a big believer in alternative medicine, in fact i rarely see allopathic doctors anymore. that doesn't mean i wont date a doctor! i try to eat only organic and teach my children the same. i'm a true ""greenie"" but i dont impose it upon others, though its much appreciated! im a former wall street trader, so you will have to excuse, or relish in, my potty mouth. for the record, i only have one cat, but they dont give you the option on okc to say that!"
218,"i am a human male. i have ten fingers and ten toes. for now and for the foreseeable future, i have hair.  other points of interest include: the ability to drive a car while eating a burrito, despite never having done so.  (can you tell that i don't take okcupid seriously? more like okstupid.)  also the thing i said about the burrito is a lie. i've done it before, and i'll certainly do it again."
219,"i'm friendly, content and upbeat... even if the circumstances around me don't warrant it. naturally, i see this as a good thing.  i'm the oldest of five. yes, five. it is loud, busy and involved, but i wouldn't have it any other way. family (and friends) are what make life worth while.  i also grew up pretty outdoorsy (think atvs and horses), so i'm not shy when it comes to anything that calls for a ponytail and jeans."
220,"im not good with writing these so here goes nothing. born in napa raisd in vallejo and still there. im kinda big but im working on loseing pounds. working on education at the moment. im funny, random, crazy, and fun. i don't smoke don't drink and don't do any drugs"
221,"i'm a pretty laid back person whos looking to have a little bit of fun. i have a great job ,a pretty flexible schedule and lots of free time. i like to hike , play tennis , dance to house , trance music , go to costume parties . i'm always looking for new adventures. i would love to do more traveling . i've lived in the bay area for 6 years now and i love it. the people are great. i love all the variety of activities , culture and food. i'm looking forward to meeting more great people through this site."
222,
223,"hi, thanks for checking out my profile. i'm a diverse multi- faceted person. i enjoy gardening, working out, hiking and backpacking dirt-bike riding, skiing,and fishing. i also enjoy getting dressed up and going out. i'm a good eater who likes many different kinds of food and also enjoys cooking. i enjoy sharing good food and wine with friends and family."
224,born and raised in the east bay. open minded and easy going.
225,"i'm a fun, laid back, go with the flow kind of girl. i love being active and adore being outside doing pretty much anything. one thing i would love to learn how to do, is surf. i own my own dog walking/pet sitting business, which certainly appeals to my desire for the outdoors. i'm not the kind of girl who allows her fears to overcome her, i'm more of a ""i'll prove i can conquer this"" kind of person. i have a total sassy side and like to joke around a lot and i have yet to see a ""horror"" movie that truly scares me and challenge anyone to try and change that. humor is such a huge thing to me and i love to laugh!  i'm looking for someone to complement who i am as an individual (and no, not verbally..although that's nice too ;-). my ideal dude would be someone who loves to be active and do things outdoors and travel. a dude who has a solid job and a funny, easy going personality is a must have as well."
226,
227,"fun loving, active, interested, and warm.  live well, laugh often, love much.  solid friend. committed teacher. loving sister. wait! this sounds like a eulogy. eesh.  people i cherish stay close to my heart and many have known me for over 25 years. teaching in a public school is difficult but i don't know many people who love there job as much as i do. i am the youngest of three amazing older sisters and you can see each of them in me. my sisters are great friends and my friends are like sisters.  exploring foreign countries, music, and spending time in nature invigorate me. i have lived, worked, and studied in many different places: mexico, columbia, indonesia, cuba, thailand, nicaragua, peru, chile, brazil, and scotland to name a few. exotic roommates like spiders and boa constrictors usually don't scare me.  i'm the girl you can take on a date to a taco truck in the mission, camp in big sur, mingle at a fancy party, or dance to some great music.  i'm generous, straightforward, and compassionate. also, i consider drama to be a huge waste of time.  health is a priority. i love running, bootcamp, skiing, swimming, hiking, and just about any activity that gets my heart rate up. if you're brave, i have some new recipes that taste delish and won't require use of a defibrillator.  urbanite? sure. however, healthy doses of the outdoors are required at regular intervals to keep me sane."
228,"note: i have updated my profile to reflect the fact that i will be moving to san francisco on august 1st, 2012. presently i live in mountain view, so it is not much of a hike to meet new folks in ""the city"" as it stands already. standard profile begins...now:  i am a hopeless romantic. i really try to believe the best in everyone, and i hope for the best in myself. i regularly tell people i am the luckiest person i know.  i use 1980's phrases like ""keen"", ""rad"" and ""badass"", and i am told i have a rather peculiar vernacular. i really enjoy talking...in fact if i am nervous i talk even more. i really love useless, but interesting trivia.  i adore traveling and taking risks as much as possible. i enjoy the rush i get by being pulled out of my comfort zones as well. my favorite places i have visited are paris, dubrovnik, sicily and hong kong. i have lived in richmond, va, baltimore, md, right outside of dc (gaithersburg), and now silicon valley.  i am actually an introvert, but being in high-end sales and acquisitions for years, i have learned how to carry on engaging conversations with practically anyone, so most people actually think i am super extroverted.  sarcasm is a critical part of my life, and i greatly value wit and cleverness. i enjoy ""creative swearing""... anyone can say ""shit"", but ""misanthropic fuck-tard"" is a lot more amusing, and most likely more appropriate.  i am fascinated by robots, museums and multi-hour conversations. my favorite video games are galaga and mario kart 64. i love roller-coasters and people who smile all of the time. i can be very easily convinced to go see or do something just because it's weird or new. i have dark auburn hair, am left handed, and i am an only child. i have been in the bay area for about 6 months and on the rare occasion i have a drink at a bar, it is typically a double shot of well tequila on the rocks, no lime or salt. i am very easily distracted by shiny objects, and i think i am totally awesome-sauce."
229,"one person, one vote - this is california, right?  woman wants manwhere you at? tall glass of water would like to meet a man with a healthy thirst - for complementary connection - and, you know, sharing. if you're 50 - 63 (give or take a few), that's ballpark. i was hoping to have tripped over you by now, but either our timing is off, or i'm far too graceful; i suspect the former."
230,"you seen battle royale? 12 monkeys? labyrinth? i'm like that. you can be however you want, but i'm like that.  i'm new to san francisco - though i was born here, i was raised in the midwest. in the last few years, i haven't stayed anywhere for more than nine months. i think this last move is final."
231,"i am an attractive, fun, smart and energetic gal who enjoys sporting events, cycling, sailing, golfing and dining out. i am just as comfortable in a little black dress as i am in a pair of jeans and a baseball cap.  i have two grown boys, one who is out on his own and one who still lives at home and is attending college full time.  i love to travel and have been fortunate enough to visit some great places over the past few years. i have a great sense of humor and can be very spontaneous at times. i love to laugh and i enjoy being around family and friends.  my ideal match would be someone who has a passion for life and doesn't take himself too seriously. he is honest, confident, adventurous, playful and has a great sense of humor. he also works hard but values balance in his life.  if you feel that we have something in common and you are seeking the same, please drop me a line.  i do not respond to profiles with no pics. no exceptions!! also, if your pics are not current, please do not contact me."
232,"i am a midwestern transplant (from chicago) with old-fashioned values such as honesty and sincerity, but now love everything the west coast has to offer. i'm laid-back, easy going, and fun!  i am very active and love to explore. i find adventure in almost anything. what i would like most is to have someone to enjoy that with and even more importantly, to make a deep connection and explore intimacy.  what i think is important in a relationship is support, kindness, love, and affection. i am romantic; love to give and receive surprises and flowers, and do the little things that let's my girl know how special she is.  as far as personality, i'm basically pretty quiet and on the shy side at first but also willing to take my clothes off in public (a big risk-taker general). a dichotomy i guess."
233,"i am retired from sales of business telephone systems and teaching high school french.  i came to california after growing up in indiana and graduating from indiana u. which included a year studying in france and travelling europe. i live in the oakland foothills.  i like to spend leisure time outdoors walking or taking care of the yard, being with friends, spending time with my 13-year-old niece. i watch very little tv - only a news show and possibly charlie rose, depending on who is appearing. i like travelling to a warm climate once a year (i've gone to puerto vallarta the last three years) and car camping. i would like to try kayaking. i'm considering getting a keyboard and playing piano again.  i like bluegrass, rock, folk, some country music.  i believe we need to keep obama in office so he can bring us closer to equality in our country.  i am looking forward to doing fun things with you."
234,"i'd like to think i'm a pretty normal guy. i'm not extraordinary in any way but i love ordinary; it gets such a bad rap in my opinion. my life's really simple, and honestly not that interesting; it doesn't take much to make me happy.  i'm a designer. it basically means that i give a lot of thought and care to what things are, why they are, how they look, and the relationships between all those. it also means i'm a very visual person.  i love movies. i love everything about film. i still love the experience of going to and watching in a old theatre. i hate that liking old films or foreign films is interpreted as snobby. i feel like there's so many great movies i haven't seen yet, so i'm really into older stuff, but i'm also down for new releases too.  i love traveling. i try to get out of the u.s. as often as possible. i enjoy breaking my daily routine and being out of my element, it forces you think think about everything taken for granted. in may 2010, i spent my month-long sabbatical all over japan. i've also been to thailand, vietnam, scotland, and briefly to various spots around europe.  i want to be healthy. more and more it seems like the most important thing. since hitting a milestone birthday, i've tried to change my lifestyle and behave more health consciously: - actually eating breakfast (still having a hard time with this one) - eating more veggies and less meat (love my pork) - running (not nearly as much as i should) - getting to bed earlier (love my sleep)"
235,"i've been told i am funny (in a somewhat sarcastic way), witty, smart and geeky. my idea of a fun night is sitting on the couch watching a movie we can then discuss afterwards. i can be intense, but i can also laugh at myself. i come off as shy at first, but i relax once you get to know me."
236,"hello! and welcome to my world; do come in and have a seat. do you want something to drink?...  i'm looking for...fun? adventure? warmth? shelter from the storm? a comrade or sister in arms? a lover? a bff? yes, all that but of course i have firm boundaries and limits too, like i most want a solid part-time relationship, not a full-time thing leading to marriage or more kids type of thing. i am independent yet flexible, and would make a wonderful mistress, even if you are not involved in any kind of relationship ;-p  i'm...more wry than funny, casual then made up, experimental then rote, outward then inward, more perspicacious than dim, more sensitive than objective (nah, maybe that's not entirely true!), forthright instead of obsequious, initially more skeptical than trusting, more lucid than abstruse, more straightforward than recondite, more idealist than pragmatic (as much as i deny it!)...  i was born in the midwest (oh), but have spent over half my life in the sf bay area (and sonoma co), so i have both the farm girl (i can seriously milk a cow!) and hipster urbanite blood within me...on second thought, probably more nerd than hipster...but i'm comfortable in both locales and proud of those quite mixed roots.  i'm happiest... working in my garden any 'ol time, at a huge flea market or going to an estate sale early on a saturday morning (picked up many many beautiful and rare treasures in my time), being out walking/hiking in any season rain or shine, reading my new yorker (love the short fiction!) constantly, being hands-on in the middle of a diy project, cooking and trying some new interesting recipes (but usually only following it the first time), loving someone from deep within my being, dancing around in my living room, singing a fantastically melodic beatles song...life is rich and there is much to enjoy (art shows, poetry, walking/hiking/sailing, traveling, seeking beauty, reading, contemplating our navels, etc.), so yes, let's try that wine, eat at that new place we just read about, take the ferry to hike the hills across the bay; let's live!  i consider myself polyamorous, not into the poly group scene, and my 'version' of poly in practice is more closely aligned with wendy-o' matik's viewpoint than easton/liszt. please be aware that i am involved in a relationship/deep friendship but i have taken the liberty to list myself as single because listing myself as the former seems to severely limit okc interactions and i am in many senses of the word single...with this being said, i shy away from labels about who you and i are and what types of labeled relationships people create together."
237,"im a very open minded person with a real dry sense of humor, i love having a good time and enjoying life. i cant stand ignorant people but they can sometimes be entertaining for me. im looking for new friends or ""whatever"" outside of my circle."
238,new to the online dating and here to check things out and see how it goes.
239,my name is ben and i'm a senior in high school. i've been in a couple long relationships and i'm looking for something not too serious before i leave for college. i'm looking for someone fun!!! my political views are very liberal.
240,"i like traveling (back and forth from my job), earning money (for my employer) and seeking adventure (stories to read on the interweb). i am tall (compared to my 4' 11"" grandma) and caring (to my house plant). and apparently i like parentheses (who doesn't?)."
241,single independant woman. married at 22 divorced at 24 no children (of my own). very happy and enjoying life. first generation (born and raised) in san francisco to italian immigrants. new world woman with old world values......willing to share more with an emotionally avl. man.
242,"just living life one day at a time, doing things on my own time, trying not to stress out too much or take life too seriously. i've been single for 2 years and decided to join this site with the hope of finding a good woman to fill that empty void in my life. i decided that it's now time to finally move forward after 2 years of adjusting and mourning. i guess i just realized that it's time for me to be happy and live life to the fullest, looking forward to a bright future and finding someone special to share it with. i have spent so much time trying to make myself better in every possible facet of my life. i've gotten better in some areas and worse in others, but i'm hoping that i'll find a woman who can bring out the very best in me, and hopefully, i'll bring out the best in her as well. i'm an easy-going guy, with a great sense of humor. i can be a little shy and at a loss for words when meeting new people, but i get pretty comfortable quickly and am quick to start joking around. i believe laughter truly is the best medicine, and i take pride in my ability to make people laugh."
243,"ok so im not rilly a wizard and i dont wear glasses but i'm a self employed guy who likes the outdoors, motorcycle riding, rock climbing, nice food and interesting people.....and hates republicans.......but likes guns"
244,"open-minded, but usually know exactly what i want. get a lot out of helping other people, especially on big-picture stuff. people tell me i make them feel good about themselves. i just think i'm kinda perceptive and ain't scared to give compliments. new england at heart = integrity + sass. you may have to deal with some unsolicited astrological advice, but it's all outta love and an effort to support and help. you can always tell me to shut up, especially if you follow it with a good tongue-kiss. i believe in things that can't be proven. done a lot of soul-searching and grown a lot in my late twenties. the afterlife and the subconscious fascinate me. i like orange soda.  i am into it, over it, and full of it"
245,"update: i'm ready for l o v e !! i just need someone that is committed to the process of getting to know each other. i'm definitely open to ages and races but sex -- men only please :) people seem to want to just rush into things and pow have everything be like a fireworks display and then i think they tend to fizzle out just as fast. so...i'm just open to friendship right now...  previous: i guess i'm just not in the mood of talking myself up and would rather just get to know someone and listen to them talk about themselves and let them get to know me in a way that has a more natural flow ;-) this doesn't mean i can't hold a conversation it just means that sometimes i wish i could wave a magic wand and have my soulmate here beside me. i'm saying this somewhat facetiously because i really don't think i believe in the idea of a soulmate. even if i was with a person for 30 years and they (god forbid) passed away, i would still want to believe that there was another love out there for me. yes, that is thinking a bit too far in the future but i'm working on trying to live more in the moment lol. i would like to meet someone that is open-minded without being super liberal and crazy. the current definition of open-minded is sort of a free-for-all and i don't view it that way. i would say i'm more of a moderately conservative person in some ways but i definitely have my wild and spontaneous side. i'm a bay area native currently living in the east bay but originally from the city. i'm in the technical field (who isn't!) but am currently considering a return to school for a masters degree and a career change. i have two teenage sons and i love them dearly but once they're grown and gone it's gonna be all about me! lol they don't need a dad but someone that is teen-friendly would be a welcome addition to my life. anyway back to the soulmate thing. sometimes you just meet someone and everything is so easy and just falls into place effortlessly. the problem with that is sometimes it's so easy you forget to view the red flags and warning signs. i would like to meet someone and keep my eyes open but still have the pieces fit together like that. i'm not a person that really has favorites. there are a few categories of things (movies for example) where i do have some favorites but overall i might have a consuming interest in something one year and the next year i'll be on to something else. i definitely don't have a favorite song or color or day of the week or anything like that. this makes me more flexible to be open-minded as to my partner's interests but i have enough things that interest me and enough life-long friends that i won't try to lose myself in the other person's life but still have my own interests as well. i wouldn't want to be with someone that requires so much ""alone"" time though that we don't have enough time together. okay that was rambling but i hope i've said a little about myself at least to give you an idea of, if not who i am, then, who i would like to be with lol some interests: reading spoken word poetry (hearing) comedy shows live music hanging out with friends and family going to the movies surfing the 'net' travel  i am awake, aware, and significant"
246,"i've been told i am an extrovert but i feel like an introvert. while i may feel shy when first meeting someone, i quickly transform into the fun, witty, and often ridiculous alter ego of a superhero (sorry, it's against league of justice code to reveal my superhero identity). everyone has some wisdom to share and i revel in the opportunities to engage with others and learn new things. germany was home for 3 years and i've traveled to 12 different countries, which has widen my view of the world and left me culturally open minded. my friends tell me i'm an entertaining, energetic, and passionate person. it's true, i'm passionate about life, about politics, and passionate about human existence and exploring the depths of human consciousness. with my playful sense of humor i tend to be ""the funny guy."" don't bother to reach out to me if you don't enjoy laughing.  dating sites are strange, but we're all here anyway. i'd like to find someone who shares similar qualities as me (hopefully you're looking at me because the okc algorithm says we're a good match). i guess i'm here looking for someone who really enjoys experiencing life from one spontaneous moment to the next."
247,"in the city for 11 years, i am an only child from colorado where i was raised by my not very interesting asberger's pianist dad (no, i can't play and asberger's is not hereditary) and a nice, operating nurse mom. i'm hardworking and you should be too.  i'm independent, witty and punctual"
248,"looking for a good time, life goes by fast not to enjoy it to the fullest"
249,"i was born and raised in the bay area. grew up in pacifica. being an only child has made me independent and self sufficient. i am extremely close to family and friends.  i am honest, loving, loyal, supportive, adventurous, nurturing, fun, social, hungry for culture, travel and more! life is too short so i make the most of every situation, have a good time and always have a positive outlook!"

252,"i love to laugh, have fun and i appreciate a good sense of humor! i'm looking for someone who is fun loving, loves to travel, and can laugh at himself and me! i like to enjoy this beautiful area that we live in. love to dance, listen to music, go to festivals (we are so blessed on the west) travel, do seva, practice yoga and am a true water baby. i'm a true romantic and i believe that it is important to keep romance alive ! i believe that we have the power and strength to manifest anything that we put our mind to. i believe in synchronicity and cosmic connections. from a young age i was brought up studying and practicing vedanta under the guidance of h. h. swami chinmayanandaji both in india and the us. i strive to incorporate eastern values and traditions with western openmindedness. i'm looking for a man that honors and respects his indian heritage but is also worldly and appreciates other cultures and traditions as well! i love to shake a tail feather! afro samba anyone???  my hindi is ok, its seen better days!  i am om, shanti, and om"
253,"i have: neat handwriting. good posture. lots of books. i tend to: over-think things. spill on myself. talk a lot when i'm nervous. i almost never: get truly angry. break a promise. forget a face. i nearly always: laugh at bad puns. want to hike longer. will have another beer!  i'm a happy and thoughtful person who has a pretty low threshold for bullshit. this means i am pretty upfront with people, and it's easy to tell how i'm feeling. besides that, i like making inappropriate jokes at generally inopportune times, but then am charming so everyone feels at ease with my occasional awkwardness.  my friends know me as funny, honest and supportive. i have a few really really close people in my life, but i also like cultivating a wide group of friends.  i was born and raised in san francisco and am still deeply in love with the bay area. other places are super great too, and i like going to visit them, but this place.... it's my home."

260,"one of my endeavors was to learn to put a tiny little fly onto a string hanging off a rod and wade into the rushing water to find suspecting trout to outwit. i love rivers and would no doubt have been happy as a suspecting trout too. maybe next lifetime. there's a question for you to answer, which animal would you have been happy to be if you hadn't been a human? ok, i'm not great at writing about myself, so i'm procrastinating. i guess i see myself as developing and growing. relationships help us to do that, and they add to our lives in so many ways, so i hope to find one that does - someone that i make a good team with. i work with others well, sharing responsibilities, encouragement, ideas, goals, affection and laughter to name a few things. i am very loyal, loving and giving to those around me. i love to cook with and for people, it makes me happy.  i am very active, hike, work out, dance and jump around whenever possible - cosmopolitan nature girl, just at home in a museum in ny city as a tent in the mountains. i like to dig in the dirt and sometimes things even grow. i love to travel and discover new places, there's a never ending supply of new places to explore around here. i haven't traveled far away as much as i'd like and hope to do that more in the near future. i have been to europe, mexico and canada. of all places i loved the french alps the best so far.  i have 3 wonderful children who don't need me much anymore and have their own lives ( i started early) who are a joy to me every day still."

263,"hi! just joined, will fill in soon. :)"

266,"i am looking for chemistry and companionship, an equal relationship, someone who loves their life and wants to share it with me. someone who is sweet. like me. if you are a glass half full person, excited about life and discovering all it's wonders, energetic, curious, adaptable, spontaneous person, please contact me because that describes me pretty well. i like to look at life with childish glee, and i make it fun."
267,"i hope you're a pinch unique -- and have a curiosity about the world, appreciate creativity, punctuality, find the good in things, understand that muscles are meant to be used, good food is meant to be eaten, and, welp, strive to be the kind of person dogs think their owners are.  and if you slip once in awhile? that's ok, too.  i'm a scientist, and i've taken a new job that has me situated in the lower 48, new to the bay area (and online dating). much of my job is running around in a little boat mapping the seafloor, creating nautical charts. i respond to whatever ruffles up the water or lurks underneath threatening safe navigation, too. i really like water, and am thankful to live near it, work on it, and play over / under, inside out of it.  i didn't take the usual route in life. i'm a journeyman. i've been a bunch of places, enjoyed a few adventures; been there and back again. i am proud that i'm not a wishy-washy guy that talks about what he would like to do, what could be, what's over the rainbow.  nope. i get it done. i am.  i've paid my dues, worked my way through school for a computer science degree, and then topped it off with some graduate work in remote sensing. after college i promptly toughed it up in alaska for ten years working in the field, three of which living off the grid in a floating cabin, and another four serving aboard a 321 foot ship conducting hydrographic survey.  i ended up a working professional, responsible for expensive things and trusted with the safety of others.  my friends tell me to mention that i can ride a unicycle and juggle at the same time. they say girls dig that, but my circustry is a deeply personal thing -- like maybe something i might do on the fourth date.  lastly, i grew up with artist parents who encouraged creativity. to this day i appreciate the simple joy of making things. i draw a lot -- mostly cartoons. i've drawn hundreds of them, most published in odd rural alaskan papers or scientific journals. i make music, too, but not very well. basically i understand creativity is a big part of life, and frivolous, joyful expression is just as important as all the serious scientific mumbo jumbo i surround myself with daily.  if you've read this far, i hope you'll go a little further and make an introduction. i feel like time's a wasting -- and there's so much more to do! let's chat soon."
268,"i am interested in vintage scooters, vintage cars, tattoo art, vintage furniture, tiki art, fleamarkets, diy projects and crafts, photography, screenprinting, gardening, local art, documentaries, people watching, live music.  i like to get out in the outdoors when i can including hiking and car camping but am far from a survivalist. walking at the beach or on a trail with my dog, car camping or spending the day at a lake are more my speed.  i've worked in tech and am now in public health. i put my time and money into causes i'm passionate about."
269,"a new england transplant, i came to san francisco a little over a year ago for my amazing job. my friends would describe me as being: thoughtful, conscientious, preppy, organized, and sometimes a little bit quirky. some of my interests and hobbies include: reading, wine tasting, shopping, interior design, photography, dance, the dailey method, going to the beach, lawn games, art, and traveling"
270,"i love learning and trying new things, random surprises, staying active, and occasionally enjoy the quiet night indoors."
271,"i laugh at puns. i always take time to stop and smell the roses, literally and proverbially. i am almost always punctual- usually 5-10 minutes early- arriving anywhere when i have made a commitment. i love to be near the ocean and to fill my senses in the peaceful silence of the redwoods. i especially enjoy cooking and sharing the joys of food with loved ones. i *really* appreciate a good hug.  i am affectionate, bodacious, and a damn good catch"
272,"i'm sophisticated, intelligent, attractive, eclectic ~ one of a kind.  generous of spirit, compassionate and supportive, i dance to the rhythms of my own heart and i honor my intuition and trust my instincts. the motivating factor in my life has always been love.  i live close to the city for the energy and cultural opportunities it provides, but being with nature is something i will always need...the silence and solitude of a redwood forest and the deep darkness of a country night."
273,
274,"so i'm steppin outta road. unsure of what i'll find...but i'm always curious to find out.  i am humble, grateful, and blessed"
275,"hi, my name is tim. welcome to my profile.  i grew up on the east coast, and came out to berkeley for grad school. after spending a few years here, i fell in love with the bay area and have decided to stay for good. i decided that the combination of weather, people, and nature was worth far more than better pay elsewhere.  now, i want to settle down and start writing a new chapter of my life, hopefully with someone who shares my view of the world."
276,i laugh almost as much as i breathe...expert in the random and ridiculous...wingin' it > structure...dancer to the core...music makes my world go round...forever exploring...always interested in the story behind the person...  what's yours?
277,"i'm a cleveland transplant (7 years ago) now masking as a fog-drenched san franciscan; a slightly eccentric scientist/physician who's a sucker for foreign films, whip cream, topographic maps, foreign kitsch, and thai massages; an introvert convincingly disguised as a gregarious extrovert; more or less sane but blessed with an occasional flaw and quirk. i'm a hedonist for sushi splurges, unscripted adventures, and late sunday mornings spent lounging in bed. i have a curious, imaginative, and creative personality and i like the challenge of discovering/learning new things. i'm an inhaler of nature, and have an inordinate fondness for the outdoors (notwithstanding my acute flying, buzzing, stinging' insect phobia). for those fond of keyword searches [because he hasn't got time to wade through the mire]: run, bike, ski, backpack, art, theatre, dance, lectures, swing dance, ethnic foods, the economist, world affairs, orienteering, scuba dive, travel, kayak, and (the ultimate high) riding in the bike lane' with the renegade drivers of san francisco.  besides my family and friends, my most valuable possession is my well-tattered passport. i put a strong emphasis on exploring the world beyond our borders, acquiring a broader picture of life & culture. my favorites so far- rwanda, iran and tibet. although now more interested in putting down roots than wandering abroad, i make the best of my vacation allotment and get myself to a far flung locale each year.  i am in a great place in my life. i've been around the block a couple times, learned some lessons- some easily but many the hard way- which i value immensely, and now am ready to apply them. i am ready to move forward in my life, partnered with a best friend and lover, and focus on building something together.  i am hoping to find that certain someone that can make any event or situation the only place worth being. a personality that is as charming as the smile they share with the world. out-going, athletic and spontaneous, while at the same time relaxed and leisurely, intelligent, sincere and possessing the virtues that make up a great friend. brains turn me on as much as sensual things; i love an independent thinker with a vivid imagination. kindness, honesty, integrity, loyalty, and tenderness are tattooed on your soul! unwavering curiosity, beaucoup passion, combustible chemistry, seemingly telepathic, incessant, time-defying communication, and cheek-hurting laughter are always nice, too. the frosting would be to meet a man who can also negotiate a rickshaw ride across town for 20 rupees or less. perhaps most importantly, you want a relationship in which we'd share interests, challenge yet support each other, and expand each other's frontiers. a long shelf life is desirable. other than that, surprise me! i love to have expectations shattered now and then."
278,"hi there,  i will do my best here to offer you a snapshot, or perhaps even a zoom-in view of myself and my world. i do this knowing that there is no substitute for what happens in real life - you know, like when two people are close enough to actually sense each other. i do know that engaging in live, two-way conversation feels much more real to me than describing myself to you this way, but here goes.  my friends describe me as passionate, playful, expressive, and adventurous. i'm all about my next adventure and i have a big appetite for life. i aim for a combination of routine and spontaneity in my day to day. i'm fortunate to posses a natural buoyancy toward life. i've cultivated that by being pretty vigilant about watching my mind and not necessarily believing the stories it likes to generate. there's often quite a gap between 'story' and 'reality'. as byron katie likes to say: ""reality is always kinder than the story we tell ourselves about it.""  i get along great with kids because i still have a lot of kid left inside me, but i have also graduated to full adult-hood. i pay my bills on time and don't make too many messes in life. (well maybe some intentional ones, like when i'm finger painting with chocolate pudding) if i like something, more is good, if not, there's plenty else to try. i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my emotions, i wouldn't trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big pleasure, i also like a day in my pj's every now and then.  i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine, it's such a rich and unique alchemy. what i'm drawn to in a a man is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone who's comfortable enough in himself that he doesn't need to pretend, posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure enough that when he's feeling something he can share it honestly. at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if you're familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.  my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic, engaged, and a lot of fun. i'm drawn to connecting with those who are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to live, act, and make decisions from today. we all have shadow, and one of it's favorite places to show itself is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that, and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty quickly.  i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what i'm getting, than how i'm contributing, and i strive to have a positive impact whenever i can. i'm definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also need some down time to hang with myself.  although i love children, i'm probably not looking to have any, but i sure like playing with them. i wouldn't rule out relationship with you if you're a dad, so long as you've also got time and space for another significant relationship in your life."

281,"i have a zest for life and a passionate heart. i'm authentic, caring, affectionate... outgoing and introspective at the same time. i have depth, integrity, compassion, and enjoy being creative. i love to laugh! i find a good sense of humor, and a smart wit very attractive in a man. i believe in treating people the way i want to be treated. i'm openminded and openhearted, and willing to take a chance on something i believe in."
282,"hello, i see you're checking things out. welcome to the modern era, right?  a little about me: i live in oakland, i used to live in new england, i work regular hours but have been known to escape on short notice, my dog is (seriously) the best dog ever, i enjoy climbing in the sierra and sometimes indoors, skiing when conditions warrant the drive (i.e. a lot this past winter), and otherwise keeping things mostly sane. ""fitness"" seems a ridiculous pursuit in its own right, yet i enjoy doing things that warrant being in shape.  dogs and babies like me. so, if you think you can revert to your infantile/canine roots, you might like me too.  though not terribly shy in person, given the medium i'm choosing to keep (some) things in check. i understand (and certainly appreciate) the tacit chemistry that has been known to overtake our immediate and reptilian urges, but what i am seeking is the kind of long(er)-term coupling that will continue to be interesting, grow organically, and allow for change. if this makes sense to you, please nudge me in the ribs when i become aloof without warning.  nb: i am terrible at feigning disinterest. you will (or damn well should) know if i am interested."
283,"i am an adventurous man who like exploring new places ,going to good restaurants and being in the outdoors as much as possible."
284,"ok well i guess its time to spill my guts out to the world....and notify the people who read this how wonderful and down to earth i am. lol but thats boring, i live with myself everyday and come to realize that id rather ""you"" get to kno me without the persuasion of my perception i love bein a mommie to a lovely 3yr old.... thats #1 without a doubt"

287,"i am a creative, adventurous, mischievous yet responsible and practical woman. i am playful, happy, upbeat and fun. i forge my own path in the world and am a bit of a non-conformist. at the same time i like to be able to take part in the worlds or roles of hippy, corporate worker bee, artist, renfaire or dickens fair, victorian waltzes, steampunk and down-to-earth friend. one of my favorite afternoons ever was spent on the playa misting people from the back of a two-seater bicycle.  stuff i do: i have a full time job and a part-time business. i enjoy (in no particular order) hiking, kayaking, painting, art, yoga, meditation, going to the gym, reading, languages, card and board games, yard sailing, learning to play the guitar, playing with my 2 cats, fire spinning, hanging out with friends, seeing movies and films, thinking esoteric thoughts, eating healthy meals i have cooked and cuddling when i fall asleep.  that previous paragraph makes me sound so busy. i also like to just chill!  philosophically: i am left-leaning, believe in equality, fairness, helping others, respect and the power of gratitude. i love nature and animals and believe humans are the stewards of the earth and must care for it.  looking for: a partner who has a bright outlook on life, enjoys being active outdoors and mellow indoors, likes thinking and expressing himself, enjoys exploring new places and is more inclined to place an insect outside than kill it. also, if he had a dog that could be really fun. i have dog envy right now."
288,"i think it is very hard to summarize myself in a paragraph or so but in a few words i'm a nice person and like meeting new, interesting people. i love dancing, it is a passion of mine and something that keeps me going. in my free time i love being outdoors usually going to the beach or the park with my dog. i like watching sports i am a huge football fan! i love traveling and wish i could take a year or two of my life and just travel around the world...besides the states i've been to canada, mexico, italy, and tahiti .... next up i think will be samoa and hopefully sometime this year but i would definitely like to travel some more in my lifetime...if you want to know more about me you can ask! :)"

292,hey. i'm trying to make the most of this life and meet some awesome people. maybe this site can help with the latter.  i'm optimistic about the future but never miss an opportunity to seize the day.
293,"i live for the thrill of being able to disappear on city breaks to places like the hilly streets of the city for a glimpse of the gorgeous bay, wandering through the cobbled streets of florence in search of local cafes and restaurants, or head down to tsukiji market for a sampling of fresh sashimi. i just love traveling (especially off the beaten path type), making new friends, sample new foods, and reading.  on the physical level, i stay motivated and in shape by swimming, cycling and doing pilates. currently, i'm mastering the art of gourmet cooking through my new-found love of food and cooking. they say, ""the way to a man's heart is through his stomach""...if so, i'm on the right path, right?  at times i can be quite boisterous  the life of the party! however, i can very easily be bribed with a good movie or a novel and a cup of hot cocoa with marshmallows ...ooh-la-la!"

298,"i am from sao paulo, brazil, and have lived in sf for 12 years. originally came to study, but fell in love and now call it home. i am unusual in many ways, very down to earth, and love things off the beaten path. i have changed careers and now have my own business, which has been quite an interesting trip. i love traveling and good food (who doesn't?) and will tell you much more if you ask me."

316,"i'm a dude trapped inside a successful adult's body and life. my life of surfing, running, snowboarding, and swimming has not ceased, but it has slowed due to family responsibilities and a high tech job.  i know how to please women with humor. that is right with humor, the #1 most valuable way to enjoy life, love and sensuality. other assets help, but humor and smart humor are #1. those of you who know, know what i mean.  i am married, and happily so, yet have seen the light of a polyamory style in the last 6 months. i have come to appreciate what many in other countries know already - it is fine to have adventuresome relationships outside of your marriage, and continue to meet new people. if you are open and honest with your spouse, then things work out. in my case, both my spouse and i are in the same mindset and are both pursuing outside new friends. it has added excitement and energy to our individual lives, and our life as a couple. no face photos as i have kids in middle and high school, and some discretion is required (""dad, my friend said her mom saw your picture on a dating site, wtf""). happy to send more pictures after some discussion.  i summarize what another friend told me 2 months ago when i told her i was exploring this new approach. she said ""marriage should not be like a prison. you should not have to stop meeting new and interesting people and having human connections. the most miserable people tend to be those that stay monogamous on some moral grounds"". turns out she has been doing this for 5+ years. i urge people to open their minds to the concept."
317,"if you are anything like me, you probably looked at my pictures first before you read my summary. i change my hair a lot. that is why i look different in all my photos. i went to school for cosmetology a few years ago and feel the need to switch things up often.  also, i am the kind of person that will always tell you the truth no matter how ugly. i am just as honest with you as i am with myself. i am not a slave to fashion. i don't like being around people that are more concerned about what you do for a living then who you are. i have an open mind and try to get to know everyone. i can't stand know-it-alls because no one knows-it-all. and i try to take every life experience as a learning lesson."
318,"i'm am a easy going simple kind woman, looking for a friend and partner to share life's journey. i love being out in nature exploring and discovering new and exciting places. i enjoy sports, photography, gardening, movies, music and dancing. i'm affectionate and a hopeless romanitc. full of life ... love to laugh. take my hand, walk beside me, you won't be disappointed in what you find."

320,i think i'm becoming wiser.

326,"i grew up in 12 different cities and consider myself a tck (third cultured kid - google it :-p)  i am an introverted extrovert - yes, i can be meditative or a party in a box. i'm super outgoing and can get along with pretty much anyone and can make my friends snort out laugh mostly due to my mix of sarcasm, anachronisms and terrible lack of pop culture knowledge.  update: so, okc personality meters are going super haywire - i'm not 'more aggressive' - only at work; and 'less artsy' is super wrong. oy vey!"
327,"i like driving to work like it's a race. i've wanted to be in a demolition derby ever since i saw that happy days episode. and i have been in elbow quarters competitions. i am outgoing and seem to pick somewhat shy guys. this is a mistake.  i like a smattering of activities - as long as i am with fun people, i am happy. i like to hike and camp and have decided to graduate to an aerobed. i crawled onto my friend's bed after she left our tent and was instantly converted. i used to make fun of people like that. i am now open-minded.  i appreciate offensive humor and old school manners. i tend to run 15 minutes late, but am working on it. i'm loyal and love my friends and family. i want to be with someone who enjoys holding their own with them.  i also appreciate men who ask me out on a date within the first conversation. it's so common to have messaging chemistry - it's no predictor of in-person chemistry. let's forego all the conversation and just set up a date :)."
328,"i'm a self-employed professional mill valley woman .family and friendships are very important in my life. my daughter lives in sf with her husband. we're very close and love spending time together. we especially love girl spa days where we can talk all day, catching up on each others' busy lives.  i want a best friend who makes me smile. i'd like a committed relationship with a man approximately my age to share good movies, dinners, cultural events, conversation, take long walks and have a great laugh together; someone who is genuine, affable, has a positive outlook and is emotionally evolved with a sense of humor; someone who is dependable, physically healthy and likes to talk.  the specific details of personality traits, though, are less important than chemistry which trumps traits. meeting each other tells the real story of whether there is a spark."
329,"depending on your perspective i'm either a contradiction in terms or very well balanced. i'll let you be the judge.  i can be super playful, quite funny and annoyingly energetic yet i also value and am able to sit in a place of depth, quite, and stillness for as long as it takes. that could be me meditating in silence or simply connecting with you at the end of the day. i'm grateful to have the most incredible, supportive community of friends around me, people who would do anything for me and yet i treasure my alone time. i plan my trips loosely and then look forward to getting lost on the way.  how i relate with others is incredibly important to me and i spend a lot of time getting that right. i'm a big fan of responsible communication and really believe that at any given moment we are all doing the best we can, even if what we're doing seems not so bright. what this leaves me with is a lot of empathy and compassion for others along with the ability to express myself, my love, my disappointment or whatever is actually up with me in the moment. authenticity is the name of the game.  i have big plans for the future but put a huge emphasis on the now. i'm quite good at accepting things just as they are but that doesn't mean i'm inclined to roll over and play dead either. a wise man once said, ""the world is perfect just the way it is, including my desire to change it.""  i'll definitely hold the door open for you, but i'm just as likely to smack you on the butt & chase you down the street when you least expect it. you're beautiful to me, reasonably athletic & know how to let your hair down even if it's short. you like to flirt (preferably with me) & love to kiss (also preferably with me). you also love to sweat a little, whether it's from dancing into the wee hours, a little outdoor athletic activity or a good roll in the hay. ok, we'll call it perspiration. essentially you have a strong mind, body & heart, & you're not afraid to use any of them. you are silly and playful, radiant and affectionate."
330,"let's see what can i tell you about me. if i had to pick two words to describe myself they would be ""spicy"" and ""kindhearted."" i still believe in romance. i am fun and spontaneous. i am a people person yet can enjoy a quiet night at home curled up with my man or a good book or movie. i have a good sense of humor, and i love to laugh. i was brought up in san francisco, so i appreciate the city, but i now live in the suburbs and enjoy the country as well. i think i am well-rounded and can appreciate many environments. i won't play games."
331,"originally from berkeley, usa, i have rejected the conformist natures of this community and instead fallen in love with san francisco. i work hard, but never intend to. i really want to work hard on having interesting conversations with as many people as possible.  i am troublemaking, driven, and curious"

(50/50 split but even that fluctuates with the market) so, i don't mind getting my hands dirty and love a challenge, but spiders scare me and it would take more than the sf hills to ditch my heels. unless, i'm running around cali style, at the beach, on the soccer field or in the mountains! absolutely a chameleon... which means that i turn colors to adapt to the environment (change outfits like a superhero). really, i just truly enjoy the variety of life from one extreme to the next. can you relate? hopefully not the girly tomboy part, but being a fellow chameleon with many colors."
338,"2011 was a transition year for me as i relocated back to the us after spending 4 marvelous years in ireland. i wasn't ready to leave europe, but san francisco and all it has to offer has been my savior!  i grew up in southern california, headed to the midwest for college where i studied engineering and played big 10 volleyball, and moved back to california, this time san diego, for graduate school. i've been with the same company nearly 10 years: 4 in southern ca, 4 in ireland, and now 1+ year in the bay area.  i think my friends would describe me as funny/witty with a few quirks, selfless, smart, and determined. i'm fairly low maintenance. i like roughing it but crave an occasional luxury. i'm a social person though i've dropped a few notches on the extrovert scale over the years. i'm comfortable with spending time alone as long as i've a good read. however, i love being surrounded by friends, enjoy hosting/entertaining, and usually have some travel plans in the works.  i am open minded and always willing to try something new!"

""what kind of an idea are you? are you the kind that compromises, does deals, accommodates itself to society, attempts to find a niche, to survive; or are you the cussed bloody-minded, ramrod-backed type of damnfool notion that would rather break than sway with the breeze? -- the kind that will almost certainly, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, be smashed to bits; but, the hundredth time, will change the world."" --salmon rushdie"
341,an adventurous silly professional. 
342,i love my job. i'm happy with my home. i'm on speaking terms with everyone in my family. my passport has a good assortment of stamps in it. i've even reached terms with my maker over the whole hairline thing. and any baggage i bring to a relationship is small enough to go into the overhead bin. so all in all my life is pretty great. i just hope that the next step is to find someone to share that with.  fair warning - my sense of humor might be a bit sarcastic. my taste in music leans to the obscure. and my curiosity sometimes gets away from me (and from time to time gets me in trouble). but through all that i can promise you an interesting collection of experiences.
343,"ok i decided to change my summary to make it short and simple.  i was born in nicaragura, raised in miami and have made my adult life here in sf.  here are my day to day acitivities. if you can picture yourself doing any of those things with me contact me.  i try and work out at the gym every day or go to my boxing classes when its nice and sunny you'll find me at dolores park reading a book, drinking a beer and relaxing with friends i love dancing.. salsa, hip hop, techno and electronic i enjoy traveling to events like salsa congresses, or electronic festivals i also love traveling out of the country. i do enjoy staying home, wathcing a movies, eating in and just enjoying the moment of peace that only your home can provide. love house parties, pool parties, and bars. honestly it makes no difference. i use to ride a motorcycle not anymore, but i still enjoy riding on the back of a nice fast street bike.. just in case you have one.. =) i have a helmet. hint hint!!. eating out to dinner... nothing fancy.. i will always prefer a chil location with lots of people good music rather then a fancy resturant where you have to whrisper. but i am kinda picky with food mainly becuase im allergic to pork and fish =( i love making people laugh.. i enjoy meeting new people... i am very outgoing and friendly. i'm very spontaneous, its the best way to get me out! not much of a planner unless its a trip out of the country but even then i only need a month in a advance.  do you think you can hang with me?"

352,"i'm very honest & straightforward, both with you & with me, so i tend to know what i'm about and i don't mind telling you how i'm feeling. i like people who are communicative & functional - i don't want to have to guess what's wrong, i want you to tell me, and if you're happy i'd like to hear about it. i'm easy to get along with, probably largely because i'm not very demanding and i am very forgiving - i'm appreciative of the things that work out between us and i understand that sometimes things just don't quite go as planned. so you're late, or you have to cancel something, or you're grumpy in the mornings - so what? i take everyone with a grain of salt, and i don't tend to take anything too seriously.  i like to see people i care about as often as i can, but whether that translates to once a month or twice a week is fine. some people are busy, some aren't - live your life how you want to, and i'll be happy if we can do so together. i might really love spending time with you, but i'm not going to hold it against you if you're working on a 60-hour week. likewise, i don't want you to freak out if all of a sudden i have a lot of extra work & we don't see each other as much for a while.  this is hilarious, btw - http://tinyurl.com/223fms-enneagram - it assigned me accurately, and the descriptions are (mostly) pretty solid. take it yourself: http://tinyurl.com/okc-quick-painless-enneagram - it might be enlightening.  p.s. i should apparently be somewhere between 6'4"" & 6'6"" according to the okc's analysis of how people post height - but then i should be making ""$100k+"" as well, so what the hell."

366,
367,"i know what you are doing: scanning profile pics like you thumb through a skymall catalog (part of you is interested, part of you is embarrassed you are even looking. another part is waiting for the in-flight movie to start). then, when one catches your eye you take a closer look and check out the other photos. if you are still interested, you may actually read the profile. ipso facto, if you are actually reading this that means that you might want a little insight into who i am or where i got that badass birthday mug.  i think it's pretty hard to get to know someone just by reading a few paragraphs they wrote about themselves (most likely after a few drinks). i firmly believe in the power of chemistry and the way certain people click and others just... don't. i'm merely suggesting you don't judge someone by these asinine profiles, that sometimes you need a real world meet up to find out they are asinine.  that being said, i'm honest, funny and creative. i'm intelligent, down to earth, a little sarcastic, and a hopeless romantic who doesn't think chivalry is dead. i will want to open the door for you, pull your chair out for you, and pick up the tab. deal with it.  it seems like everyone on here loves hiking and snowboarding and outdoor stuff. i'm not quite as into it as the next guy, but for good reason. (see below) don't get me wrong, i'm totally up for doing that kind of thing with the right person. (just last month someone got me climbing the stanford dish) i love camping even though i haven't been in a long time, it's just the hiking and climbing stuff that is tough for me to handle. (again, see below) to be honest, i'd much rather just chill out, cuddle and watch a movie. maybe get drunk and watch cartoons. or maybe play chess or poker or jenga. i'm always up for going out, but i do love a good quiet night at home."

372,"consider the following: on average, you are attracted to one out of every ten potential partners. this is likely an overestimate but, for the sake of argument, not an unreasonable assumption. by the same token, that one person you like has a one in ten chance of liking you in return. this means that the odds of two people hitting it off and getting along are no more than one percent. this is perhaps an alarmingly low figure, i admit. but such is the remorseless, ineluctable beauty of mathematical truth.  the question is: are we the one percent?"
373,"hot.. hi, i mean hi.  so, i'm not persian. i don't know how i came out looking like this. i'm french and black irish. its a fun observation and also odd that so many people stop to ask. its an interesting subject, the mixing of humanity's various races. i am actually pretty good at disecting a face to its origins, including the migration patterns that brought them there. i like to think about how things start.  i like to have fun like most other guys on this website. enjoy drinks, working, being creative, eating animals (wait, should there be a coma there?) superbly happy go lucky, intelligent, can carry a real conversation, not just what i did today... the only unfortunate thing is the frustration i get when dealing with negative people. i'm working on it, but if you go through life only looking at bad parts you're headed towards a swell of unhappiness  i'm a regular man's man who gets perked up over guy things, fast cars, country, building things. i do have a soft side that usually comes out when somebody needs emotional help, emotional or pyschological, whatever you want to call it.  i'm also a golden retriever."

381,"museums and holes-in-the-wall are my places of joy. i am passionate about social justice and eagerly await the day that i'm no longer stuck in a student's academic cage and can actually do something about this world we live in.  i am very independent and confident, and an unapologetic feminist. i have traveled quite a bit and learned that there are many good ways to live one's life (my obsession with serial killers notwithstanding). i believe that a little personal hypocrisy keeps us human. my bullshit tolerance is low and i don't call movies ""films.""  maintaining friendships is very important to me, and i devote much of my time to doing just that.  i admire creativity in others and i'm always looking for inspiration to cultivate my own creative impulses. therefore, i love to learn (especially about cultures and religions) and try new things (especially foods). i believe in adding as much color to life as possible! and i always go all out for halloween."
382,"i am curious and inquisitive about the world, so i take every opportunity to learn from it. i am interested in world affairs, world history, linguistics, and science.  i believe in practicing human decency on a basic level everyday.  i love to laugh. more than that, i love make others laugh at what they find funny.  i like surprises in the world like this and amusing things like this.  for women with allergies, i have two cats."
383,"ok, i deleted all my questions - i like the 0% match - it has a zen-like quality to it.  right now, i'm looking for new friends to hang out with. some of my friends are very much like me and others are my complete opposite.  i tend to feel most comfortable with people who are creating something new: dancers, entrepreneurs, musicians, artists, writers, designers.  i'm one of those people who won't be satisfied until i've created something of lasting value. i've set a high bar. sometimes i fail. sometimes i pull it off. have worked solo and in a team.  lately, i've been a little too solo - some friends have moved away - so, here i am."
384,"they say that life really starts after high school and for me i guess that's true. i graduated at the bottom of my class with no honors but decided to follow my passion anyways. i took a prestigious apprenticeship at a penguin and yak herding ranch located in iceland but the company was downsized due to global warming so i was faced with a career decision. i've always loved the idea of being lied to while getting shot at for performing an unethical invasion of a country which was ultimately motivated by profit and religious ignorance so.... i decided to join the army. after i was done being all that i could be, i once again found myself at a proverbial fork in the road of life. i decided to apply to colleges and was accepted to every ivy league school but instead opted to attend portland state university because of the fuego burrito cart. once in school i had to decide what i wanted out of life and after a few hours of sipping on creativity juice, i had an epiphany. i've always had a crush on the tooth fairy and thought that maybe if i became a dentist she would find me attractive. so here i am, new to san francisco and in my first year at pacific school of dentistry.  i am intelligent, passionate, and loyal"
385,"the most important thing you should know about me is that i'm a full-time single father to my eight year old daughter, and that it is fantastic. never knew life could be so lovely; never thought i could love so fiercely. obviously, i'm looking for someone who also sees that she is value added.  the second thing you should know about me are my friends. after my daughter, they are hands down the best thing i've got going. they are an amazing group of people, really tied into the city and the world, and we are always up to something worth the effort.  the third thing you should know about me is that i am a wave rider. when i see a plan i like, when i'm possessed by a vision of how it could or should be, i can be single-mindedly inspired (and inspiring). i tend to go for it.  i should also mention that i'm not blasting out a bunch of emails. so if i contact you, i'm interested in you, and you'll find that i try to put a little thought into what i say."
386,"i'm geeky, athletic, and energetic.  i love to eat and love to cook vegetarian.  i'm a dad with shared custody, so relax if i'm busy. i'm doing my best to give him the world."
387,"i find it a tad difficult to summarize myself. perhaps i will leave that up to the summarians.  i am artistic, adventerous, and archaic"
388,"easy going, fun, good sense of humor..."
389,"i love hiking, dancing, sports [baseball & basketball] and being out in nature.  above all i will do anything to smile/laugh.  i moved to sf in october... i'm really excited to explore and figure out the city"
390,"i am a retired machinest and aa engineer and love the out of doors like camping and fly fishing and sunsets as well as sunrises, but was in explosion 19 year's ago that left me in a roller coaster, thank goodness i was a avid bicycle rider and have great upper strength, hence have a great out look at life."
391,"ok, here goes. i've been described by friends as a renaissance man. i have my crap together and looking for the same. i work in high tech/green tech. it doesn't suck. i also enjoy real estate as a hobby. i also like to volunteer and give back. i'm kind of a jokester and i like to have fun. lived in marin since i was 5, went to school in chico, tried silicon valley, but wanted to buy a house, so moved back to marin. been divorced 5 years and very active in my kids' lives and they make me smile every time i think of them. so what am i looking for here? someone who has their stuff together - job, lives within her means, treads lightly - spiritually, physically, and emotionally. you keep your work in check. you are sweet, compassionate, caring, and we share chemistry. i usually know within the first 5 minutes of meeting. however, it's hard to put into words. being an aries, i can have mood swings where i hunker down and get quiet. a good match can help ferret out what's ailing me. exercise helps. i can be stubborn at times. i can also be very dynamic also. i am not an alpha male type. i prefer smaller gatherings where i can connect with a few people as opposed to big parties. i still enjoy big parties - after all - i went to chico. i have been described as ""running a tight ship"", but i feel i'm raising respectful kids because of it. i have a good life, looking for someone to complement me and for me to complement. you should email me if anything here resonates. no, really.  warning: any institutions or individuals using this site or any of its associated sites for studies or projects-you do not have permission to use any of my profile or pictures in any form or forum both current and future. if you have or do, it will be considered a violation of my privacy and will be subject to legal ramifications. it is recommended that other members post a similar notice."
392,"i'm a super creative person, and i believe nothing is worth doing if you do it half-assed. i was stuck in boring job and hated it... for years... but now all that has changed. i followed my dreams and opened a fashion boutique in 2009 and soon my best friend & i are opening a club and a spa.  i'm real nostalgic. i love traditions. i love reminiscing. i believe in helping others always and being charitable. being confident, having your shit together in your personal & professional life, being compassionate and treating people with kindness is something that is non-negotiable when it comes to people i date. if you have kids, that would be actually kind of cool. but you gotta be the best dad ever - raising them in a positive loving way. support them 100% in everything they do. please, no crazy ex-wives that drain you dry, leaving you bitter as hell. that's just no fun.  san francisco is amazing and will always be my home base. i lived in nyc for almost 3 years and miss it like you wouldn't believe, but i deep down i'm a california girl. someday, i will have an apartment there and one in paris... ."
393,"i've got the best job in the world living in the best city in the us. last year i took 3 cross country road trips and passed through about 25 states and oh, by the way moved here! i love exploring and this country is soooo beautiful and diverse. obviously i love adventures and exploring and getting lost and finding myself. that being said last year kind of wore me out. as if moving accross the country isn't enough the extra back and forths were awesome but ehausting. i just finally feel like i'm relaxing into this city and getting to know it but its not as much fun going on the adventure alone!"
394,"i, i, i, me, me, me....i'm not a huge fan of this part of the process, but here ya go.  once you get to know me i think you'll find that i'm a very down to earth person, low maintenance, no games, no unnecessary drama. laughter is my drug of choice and the beach is my church. if you're the type who can let loose and have fun, we'll get along great!! if we connect through musical tastes, awwww yeah! not too cool or shy to get on the dance floor, fabulous! undercover nerd, even better.  those are just a few of the icing on the cake qualities. what i'm really interested in are the ingredients in the cake. integrity and accountability are essential. if you are someone who is truly kind, with an open heart and mind, then we might have something."
395,"i'm a fun loving, kind, athletic, open-minded, woman looking for an activity partner to do some of the things i like to do to have fun and also try some new things that you like to do that i have not had the opportunity to be exposed to. i am ultimately looking for a ltr. i've lived in thailand, egypt, and kenya and have somewhat of a wanderlust mentality. i am looking to spend time with someone of similiar interests and mutual attraction."
396,"i am a well rounded, self employed professional - looking to share in laughter, adventure, play and shared vision. i enjoy the outdoors, travel (though i need to do much more of both) as well as all that the city has to offer. i believe in taking care of one's body and i enjoy live music, dancing, clubs from time to time, good food and wine, nature, adventure, and intriguing conversation. although a free spirit, i whole heartedly believe in integrity, loyalty, commitment, and honor. whenever possible, i relish in special moments, be it a great conversation, a beautiful sunset, vista, or something unusual. i have traveled in europe, central america, south central asia, and southeast asia, and i consider worldliness a quality to be cultivated. i have climbed mt. shasta thrice, and half dome once. rather than small talk, i appreciate stimulating conversation, quick wit, and the occasional low brow humor. anything can be a great time with the right company. a bit reserved, i have a strong personality and opinions, and yet, i am open minded, compassionate, and expansive in my world view. my friends would describe me as playful, warm, fun, generous, wise, witty, resourceful, down to earth. i enjoy my work, and i am looking to simplify my life to what is important, enriching, and exciting. i believe in personal growth and that there is always something more to learn from life.  i am looking for a woman who knows her beauty and intelligence, who strives, has integrity, knows how to have fun, really cares about those around her, and enjoys open in-depth communication. is this you? are you independent, while loyal? are love and life's subtleties important to you? are you abundant, witty, seductive, a romantic at heart, quick to smile, giving, adventurous? you enjoy the city and the outdoors? you have much to teach and share, and are not afraid of challenges?  if so, i'd love to hear from you. drop me a line, or a wink if you'd like to chat. i barely bite."

399,"i,m energetic, easy going,like fun and activities."
400,"i'm bad at talking about myself, but to keep it short, i'd rather be outdoors than sitting on a couch. i enjoy snowboarding, running, climbing, backpacking...pretty much any outdoor activity. don't get me wrong--on a nice rainy day i like to cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie, but only after i've jumped in a puddle or two. i'm looking for a partner in crime to do these activities with."

404,i'm new here .... so bare with me on completing these questions ... :) thanks !!
405,"""fortune favors the bold.""  i am far more complicated than your average blonde, in interesting and challenging ways. i am assertive, both in my communication style and the way i carry myself. i tend to ""feel the fear and do it anyway,"" and want to meet someone who is equally intent on living well. perhaps seeking someone more mellow than me for balance (or ballast - i'm listing), but definitely a risk-taker who is not afraid to reaaaach. i would like to be the ""floater"" in the relationship for once, not the ""anchor."" i'm always the dang ""anchor."" if you understand what i am talking about, then there are bonus points in it for you.  i am an affable, curious & spirited woman who seeks out new experiences, has boundless enthusiam for meaty dicussions/debates, likes an art crawl, and a well crafted cocktail (like flora, perhaps). just discovered teroir gin from mt. tam botanicals and other local plants - yum. i dig flea markets and occasional garage sailing, foreign films and indies. i crave books, media and pop culture and believe in peppering my conversation with impromptu and obscure idioms. i'm a true gen-xer, yet carry no tattoos. love vintage cars and homes. nostalgic, homey cancer.  i strive to be a competent and thoughtful mom (who chose to have a child at 40 as a single mom before my body said ""no, thanks."") my daughter and i are having a good life together so far~ i have ""put the cart before the horse"" and now would enjoy an occasional great date! stll seeking an excellent man. i eventually want to be *that* man's best friend, confidante, ardent lover, and a safe place for him to fall at the end of the day.  a few candid tidbits about me:  personally and spiritually, i am a giving person. i always look for opportunities to connect people to people or resources. i learned years ago that money is not the only medium of exchange in life. i am kind, honest, loving and resourceful. i stick my neck out for people who i think highly of, and often for those i barely know. that is my calling card.  i was formerly an executive at a few different investment firms in sf. i left to get a life. now i'm back in the financial world on a smaller scale giving practical advice to those who need and sometimes appreciate it.  a recent acquaintance called me ""blonde jedi."" that feels about right. i'll own it. yet i am equal parts smarty-pants and gullible idealist.  i'm a member of a couple of lineage societies, because genealogy is so sexy and i know that's what will win you over about me. other, less unusual passions: cooking, meditteraneangarden design, home rehabbing, bossing around contractors, & small writing projects. if you would teach me how to take better digital photos, i will be your best friend. i am competent on the foredeck of your sailboat, but don't ask me to go camping....i have hiked all over italy and france, and would love to do similar trips with a partner in the future. i love hiking through beautiful landscapes, and then looking forward to a michelin ** meal at the end of the day.  i usually get the guy, not because i'm ""all that"" but because i have confidence and i genuinely like men. i have a modicum of charm and wit, and i love when men find this attractive, esp. if you have these qualities in abundance. (btw, i am hoping you have these in abundance, and a wicked sense of humor. that is soooooo sexy.) i love it when men know 20 fun things to do that don't require a cent. i so admire ingenuity. i equally enjoy *high brow*~  having quality relationships is the priority for me at this point in my life. i am tactful, but no shy violet. you can count on the conversation being playful, and on my teasing you about whatever seems to get your goat. i prefer to be dating an extroverted communicator type of guy.  my best job and best decision so far was to have my daughter. she is my raison d'etre. but i definitely have room for more raison d'etres. total bonus if you are kind to children and they actually like you.  i wear a size 12, 36dd and am not interested in someone who wants a waifish girl. there are many other girls on cupid who will match you better.) you want to date me because i'm firing on all burners and am strong-witted. that said, i generally prefer fit men. from my past history, i can say that i sincerely don't have a type, other than common traits: brainy, eclectic, honest, sincere, well-intended. sterling character."

408,"irrevocably drawn towards fulfilling intellectual pursuits flanked by blatant acts of self-indulgence. a veritable caricature of every extreme, cloaked by a facade of indifference and peppered with an enigmatic charm.  i also like sammiches.  the majority of these self-summaries i've read are simply outlines of the events of the user's life, which i tend to find rather boring. instead i will attempt to expound upon a far more relevant topic, the personality itself. alas, describing one's own personality is dangerous territory, so please forgive me in advance for the admissions to follow.  first and foremost, i am honest and direct - even to a fault. i am often caught making comments or observations that others would typically keep to themselves. i believe my perceptions are so apt that i can't bear not sharing them. do not confuse this with tactlessness, i am quite civil. especially when becoming acquainted with someone new, i am a perfect gentleman. however, those who know me best have confirmed, the naked truths i leak are consistently nuggets of wisdom.  secondly, i am a very well-distributed person. i am knowledgeable, worldly, and i enjoy a wide variety of interests. a 'jack-of-all-trades' if you would, i can usually find some common ground with anyone i meet. i enjoy being abreast of a variety of disciplines, from economics and industry, to food and beverages, to art and philosophy. truly, few subjects escape my interest entirely. i challenge us to share a conversation which does not contain a span during which we are both bubbling with discourse.  additionally, i consider myself to be empathetic. i am observationally sensitive to individuals, and well-attuned to those close to me. understandably, i can be both accommodating to these nuances, or sometimes entirely obdurate. my demeanor is often directly influenced by the people around me. surrounded by good friends i become the life of the party; stories, jokes, and general merriment ensue. conversely, when alone i tend to be much more quiet and reserved, shy even.  hopefully this has been an enlightening account for you, dear reader. if you are the slightest bit intrigued by the character described herein, i suggest you send along a message in the interest of fresh associations and potential relations to follow!  --{! disclaimer to literalists !}--  despite what my handle may have you believe, i am neither an alcoholic nor obsessed with sex. i've not once had erectile dysfunction caused by the consumption of alcohol. the name is simply intended to be humorous and memorable, not an indication of my personality. thank you for reading.  i am vivacious, virulent, and volatile"

411,"i have a love for good food and drinks. red wine, merlot would be my favorite. being computer savvy, i google everything! i love to write in my spare time. being philosophical, i have an open mind, which allows an opportunity to learn new things. watching movies in the comfort of home is my favorite place to watch. i do not like zombie thrillers; they freak me out too much! i love to laugh and prefer to watch comedies. domino or bones are the game of choice. i've got skills! lets play! i love music! hip hop, r&b, soul and country. i enjoy being near and around water; i love a nice beach or lake."

413,"i measure a person by how she thinks, speaks, acts rather than what she thinks, speaks, does.  so if you suck i can tell."
414,"ok, here's enough info to save us a bunch of emailing and a month of dating. i will lay it right out there exactly who i am and what i want. many men thank me for my clarity and frankness. i apologize for the length, but it's way faster in the long run. my time is precious and perhaps yours is as well. (feel free to skip over the section on books, films, food, etc. or any other section for that matter)  generally speaking, i am very content with myself and my life, yet i miss that special magic that two people can create together; and i really miss sharing the journey through life, and all the little and big ways that a relationship adds to my life.  on first dates, i'm often told that i'm really easy to talk with and very easy to be with. i suppose this is largely because i've grown quite comfortable with myself and who i am. i've worked on myself a lot for over 3 decades, and, while still/always a work-in-progress, i've come a long way in myself and in my life. i'm happy and i enjoy life. also, i have a lot of interests, i listen well and converse easily. i'm very curious about people and mostly non-judgmental.  those that know me describe me as very kind, feminine, extremely sweet, soft yet strong, gentle and firm, very present, calm, grounded, compassionate, lively, passionate, insightful, relaxed, very affectionate, interesting, super bright, curious, funny, multi-talented and creative, nurturing, generous, fun, and spontaneous...... though usually not all in the same sentence. i'm intense at times, but in a good way. men often ask me how it's possible that i'm unattached. those that know me really well would add that i'm wise, exceptionally sensitive, intuitive, and a bit of a sprite. you'll know i'm comfortable with you when you get to experience the sprite in me. :)  i have a huge heart and love full out. hopefully, you do too. that's where the 2heartsdelight happens. you'd need to be ok with being loved completely.  i have a very curious mind. i ask a lot of questions- not all of them aloud. i'm told i ask great questions. and, i don't have a need to always have conversation in the company of another. i'm fine with just being especially once we know each other a bit and are comfortable with each other.  i've developed awfully good communication skills and excellent relationship skills. men in recent years have found me rather remarkable in this way and in other ways too. i hold up my end of a partnership/relationship rather well and can let you have your experience w/o getting reactive and can manage my own experience w/o needing to process it with you. ideally, you're able to do the same. i'm past the point of needing to process a bunch of stuff in relationships. hopefully you are too. we'll process only that which needs to be processed together; the rest we'll each handle on our own. let's enjoy sharing the journey. harmony in relationship is absolutely paramount to me; life is short.  i'm a long time student (over 23 years) of the diamond approach in the ridhwan school and also of yoga. i have very very high integrity. i almost always take the high road- even in the worst of times. i'm iconoclastic, autodidactic, and very self-aware.  i live on the edge or beyond the edge of my comfort zone most of the time: my soul is on some sort of fast track. the rate of growth/transformation can be quite rapid; it's kind of out of my hands. i don't expect you to be like me in this regard, but you should know and understand this and be ok with it. i am not your average bear.  i'm realistic and i'm optimistic. i no longer sweat the small stuff and most things really are small stuff.  i am an independent thinker and think waaaay outside the box. visionary, creative, progressive,.....you get the idea.  my life is very full and fairly well-balanced; and i have plenty of time for the right man. in fact, it's a high priority for me to make time for a great man and create a great relationship together.  my spiritual life is quite significant, but the form is not rigid. i'm happier hiking, gardening, singing kirtan and bhajans, or going to a yoga class (all of those are spiritual for me) than going to church or temple although i can enjoy that too on occasion. my orientation to life is spiritual, has been my entire life and is well-integrated into my being so it's not critical for me to do spiritual things.  i'm quite self-sufficient, but much prefer partnership. i've gone from being super-competent, ultra-independent, feminist, do-everything-myself to being able to kindly ask for help, graciously accept it when it's offered, and be a feminine participant in the relationship. i'm very generous with the many feminine skills i possess. an ideal relationship for me has lots of mutual lavishing. interesting how when there's a lot of lavishing, there are very few issues....... :)  i know how to really accept another unconditionally and appreciate another fully. our chances for a really harmonious relationship increase tremendously if the same is true for you.  while having shared interests is nice, what is more important to me in a partner are kindness, self-acceptance, passion, respect, devotion to the relationship, personal responsibility, generosity, humor, lightness, fun, passion, honesty and openness. i offer all of these too.  i'm really comfortable with my sexuality as well as my libido. i'm also super affectionate and am extremely cuddly. if you are too, this could be delightful.  i'm active physically, love to hike, skate, walk, x/c ski, downhill too, snowshoe, swim, snorkel, love to dance- pretty much any kind of dance. if you'd be willing to take partner dance lessons, i'd be thrilled! i don't do any intense gym workouts, rock climb or do xtreme sports. and i'm not interested in competition.  i also enjoy quiet indoor time reading, writing, movies, sitting in front of the fire, and hanging out together, doing domestic stuff, cooking together, baking alone or together.  i'm told that although i'm quite mature, i have a youthfulness and appearance younger than my years. for this reason (and a few others), i stated my age 3 years younger than actual. people usually don't believe me when i tell them my age. really.  wrt the okc enneagram test, i am an unconventional 9 with an 8 wing; i am not an 8. i'd especially love to hear from men who are well-integrated 6s.  thanks for reading all the way through. i appreciate that it's a lot to read, but i find it saves us both a lot of time if we're really clear, self-revealing and specific."
415,"hopefulromantic was taken and 2hopefulromantic was too long... lost the ""c"". oh well ... where do i start. okay, i am a simple human being, yet with a deep soul, who has a heart of gold and who believes in fairy tales. however, i also believe that the pillars of any successful relationship are understanding, loyalty, honesty, compromise, the will to make things work, communication and respect. i believe in fate too and that people meet for a purpose of higher nature and that there is a reason for everything.  i have waited and continue to wait for my ""dream girl"" and don't mind waiting my whole life for her. i have promised myself to stay single and not to marry for the sake of being married only; i will marry when i fall madly in love with that special woman who will make my heart miss a beat every time i see her or even just think of her. just to clarify, my ""dream girl"" is not a model via the way she looks, because looks alone does not define my ""dream girl"". also, i am not going to make a long list of all the things she should be. if i did that, then i might miss a really good woman. however, for simplicity sake, i would say that i like the woman who is loyal, romantic, sweet, compassionate, sincere, genuine and who honors, nurtures and/or takes care of her mind, body and soul.  by knowing me, you would discover that i am genuine, a true gentleman, compassionate, romantic, loyal and faithful, sensitive, introvert to some degree, humble and down to earth. i dislike with passion those who play games or those who lie and cheat. i am not into one night stand, never was and never will be. watching the rainbow and hearing a laughing child make me happy; they re-enforce my hope in everything good in life. when it comes to dealing with people, i am a strong believer in the saying, treat people as you like to be treated. oh, and i love poetry (write when inspired) and good dark chocolate (with almonds and/or strawberries yet better).  i love walking, enjoy long distance driving and beginning to play tennis once again after a long layoff.  thank you and best of luck to you."

420,"i grew up in the east bay, moved to new orleans for college, and promptly moved back to the bay area. i've been living in san francisco for almost 7 years and have loved it every moment.  it's so cliche to cover the bases of contradictions; but i've been having a lot of self-reflection time lately, and i really am a generalist and a centrist in many ways. i actually do try to be all things and everything as much as any one person can. i'm a do-gooder volunteer and a joiner. i'm a leader and a follower. architect by day, security personnel by night. i'm constantly looking to learn new things and am usually on the go, but i also have no problem lounging on the couch watching an entire television series season in one weekend (lately it's been the new doctorwho). i am intense and take myself seriously at work.  i really like cats but they are constantly trying to kill me; dogs too (oh allergies).  i hold friendships forever; you have to do something really awful and unredeemable to lose my friendship. i'm lucky to still live near my parents but i don't see them very often.  i've traveled some, near and far -- last summer i was in eastern europe (germany, italy, hungary and the countries the for a time was known as yugoslavia). i would like to travel so much more and keep a running list of places to go and that list is quite long -- it's a question of money more than it is a question of time or desire. i am well-traveled in the us -- i'm about 75% complete on my goal of seeing all 50 states. i think much more highly of world-travelers if they have also traveled well in their own country. it is important, valuable and worth the expense to travel in the world, but if you don't accept and know what is important and valuable about your own country (especially one as big as the us) what's the point?"

422,"i'll be out of the country to england, egypt, oman, the united emirates, and india for the next few months... i wish you all the best and good luck!  i have two tickets to the symphony saturday night... alas, one seat remains empty. should you be interested in a night of adventure, and you have a nice dress. or perhaps its a seat on the sailboat next to me, jibing and tacking, removing the luff from the sail, pushing twixt sails butterflying in a breath of a wind, if you care to join me, then i would love the depth of genuineness in your smile, and the joy of your company."
423,"(i'm on vacation for a month)  i like people of all shapes/sizes/backgrounds. i especially like smart folks who are genuine and speak their mind. i like dill pickles fresh from the barrel, and the smell of puppy-mouth, and the way the earth smells after it rains, and the sound of a freshly-tuned guitar. i like giving massages as much as i like getting them. i like cocktails with big garnishes and little umbrellas, but also appreciate a well crafted beer or rum or bourbon.  i've noticed i usually am exceeding the posted speed limit by about 10 mph on any given day. i own about an equal amount of books and movies. the only sport i'm willing to watch on tv is soccer, preferably in spanish- even tho i can't understand the calls (and i will always root for brazil, there's a story there). i get distracted by shiny things and blinky lights. i like pumpkin curry with brown rice for lunch, and sushi almost anytime.  i can be a little quiet at first, but don't let that fool you, i can also be razor sharp in both wit and perception. sincere, and a good listener; i'm comfortable with silence, but can talk all night long over a good bottle of wine. i like trading life-stories. east coaster by birth, west coaster by choice. i'm a work in progress. i don't believe we should ever stop learning or growing.  i tend to think in both philosophical and concrete terms; i'm a bit contradictory. if life's a stage, then i'm backstage, making sure everything runs smoothly. i have many talents. and an odd sense of humor. in reality, i take care of the sick and the dying. i try to steer those i can towards a path of better health. people are very stubborn animals. the work helps me see the ways we're all connected."

425,"one of my defining qualities is an intense curiosity about the world. i am always learning new things. i love to tinker and create -- through arts and crafts, machines and tools, on computers, and in the kitchen. i'm friendly, energetic, opinionated, and kinda nerdy. my profile picture was taken in a photo shoot for a swimsuit calendar. in it, i am holding a croquet mallet and piloting a tandem. i think that's actually a pretty good snapshot of how i roll.  i am honest, adventurous, and sharp"
426,"i am having difficulty writing about myself, even though my career involves a lot of writing! where to begin... i am sweet but confident, silly but a planner, optimistic but realistic, fun-loving but goal-oriented... and i am looking forward to seeing what life throws my way next!"
427,"i like to figure things out, i tend to be cautious, loyal, but at the same time interested in new experiences. i like to know the rules, but not always follow them. i care a lot about progressive/radical politics, i like to party, dance, and play music, preferably all at the same time. i grew up in a rural area, and often feel a pull to get out of the city to some place greener. yet i have few illusions about small town life, and i love the diversity and range of activities available in oakland. i've traveled a bit, i like to cook, i like to build things. i've lived in a language i didn't (yet) speak and have since forgotten. i've been to college. my politics are generally anti-capitalist, and anti-authoritarian, and feminist but without much dogmatic tone (despite me having mentioned in twice in this summary). i'm currently in a relationship.  i am thoughtful, handy, and a geek"

431,"i'll update everything soon. figured i'd put a quick descriptionin here for the time being:  fairly laid back, curious individual. deep conversations on the meaning of life are awesome, as long as it's understood that jokes will be made periodically to lighten the mood. i can't help it.  also, i tend to think my jokes are funny. others tend to just close their eyes, sigh, and shake their heads. what can i say, i like puns.  if you're sarcastic, i am intrigued."

433,"i'm not a marxist, i just struggle a lot. lol just kidding i'm totally a marxist. also: pisces sun, libra rising, aries moon. ce que je veux est ce dont j'ai besoin.  last summer i completed and submitted to an academic institution a long-ass document, the researching and writing of which devoured the better part of my twenties and flung me headlong into a quantity of debt so ridiculous that my sole strategy for imagining it without shutting down is to launch myself into a flurry of giggles. now, though, i get to call myself a doctor in spite of the fact that i don't even know cpr. whatyouknowaboutdat??  i've recently capitulated enough to allow myself two uses of what numbers among my most despised, but also most unavoidable, words""hella""per month. that just counted as one.  ...i have a complicated relationship with my gender and sexuality that i don't plan to articulate as a complaint about the restrictiveness of okcupid categories. for me, having more categories at hand would solve little to nothing. nor would it enable me more accurately to describe my relationship to my body, much less my desires for the bodies of others. that said, i definitely understand why richer, more nuanced, and inclusive language is important for other folks' self-articulation and, above all, safety. so please don't read that as a dismissal."
434,"who am i? i'm me, it's hard to describe but it is simple ""i beat to my own drum"". my standards are high, i expect that from the people in my life and from myself. education and knowledge are king to me. whatever else you want to know you just ask. it is that simple..."

492,"i'm into pixels, caffeine, and not really sleeping at the hours people are supposed to sleep. i try really hard even if what i'm trying really hard at was never much in the first place. i'm basically well intentioned. i have a big crush on california as a state for its sheer weirdness.  it once said ""i think i may have lied about my height. i think i may actually be 5'3""."" and okcupid went ahead and changed it for me. which makes me way totally nervous."
493,"thanks for checking out my profile. i realize that the average attention span on this site is probably less than 1 minute ( just enough time to click on the photos), so i'll try to keep it brief.  here's a little about me- i love to laugh, and have a good sense of humor. i'm athletic, spirited, intelligent, loyal, honest, fun loving, romantic, and passionate. i'm self confident, but not arrogant. i believe in ""doing the right thing"", and try to practice it in my daily life. i enjoy dining out in all the unique local restaurants, weekend getaways, watching indie & foreign movies, going to plays, museums, art exhibits, and small venue concerts. i also enjoy just chilling at home having a good meal or reading the sunday ny times (preferably in bed) :-).  i stay fit by working out a couple times a week including biking to work (it's only a 20 min bike ride to work so it's not as hardcore as it sounds). i enjoy most outdoor sports including: hiking, golfing, biking, tennis (beginner), skiing & snowboarding, and windsurfing. i've traveled extensively throughout europe and asia (recent international vacations have been to israel, argentina, france), and have lived in tokyo (3yrs) and new york city ( 2yrs). living in tokyo and new york were great experiences, but i definitely prefer the quality of life in california.  i have my own investment management firm, and i've work hard to create a healthy balance between my work and personal life. i live a happy fulfilling life with many good friends and family, and it would be great to share many of life's wonderful experiences with someone special.  what i'm looking for- a woman who is balanced and grounded. someone who is fit, enjoys outdoor activities, going to movies & concerts, weekend getaways, and is willing to experience new things and likes to travel. someone who values family, is passionate, loving, loyal, honest, and is able to communicate effectively. someone who isn't self-absorbed, understands compromise, and can fill my heart with laughter and love! extra bonus points if you already have children and/or dogs, cats.... if any of this resonates with you, drop me a line. have a great day!"

(i was wild about this class and i'm not even a sports fan.)  i was, perhaps, the only one to read every word of a history (800 pages+) assigned to participants for a stanford trip to india. couldn't help it--i was fascinated. many happy hours of internet research also preceded energy upgrades on my cute new (old) house. in addition to our different interests (the spice of life), i hope you and i can share a common passion. movies or plays or books? something that i have yet to experience, or even imagine? something you introduce me to? the idea intrigues me"

587,"so i am not really sure where to begin about myself. i am a outgoing and high-spirited girl looking to meet people. its been about a year since i moved to san francisco, which has been pretty exciting =) i literally decided on a tuesday...got in the car and was in sf by thursday!  if you expect me to explain who i am in a matter of 4000 characters...good luck. can this just be multiple choice?! i feel like i am doing a college application again =0) hopefully this works out as well as that did!  so instead of writing long drawn out sentences that you may or may not read, i am gonna 'write' a bunch of characteristics about me, things i like to do, etc. if you are cool with that, awesome, if not i am sure you will still read it if you are this far ;)  i am... fun, loyal, spontaneous, dedicated, silly, loving, outgoing,open-minded, family oriented, honest, religious, confident, find beauty in imperfections, optimistic, dreamer, independent, motivated with incentives, fearful of getting hurt but fearless of life  i like... dancing, shopping (of course), water sports-- water skiing, tubing, i want to learn how to surf, sports (in general)-- ncaa bball obviously...rock chalk!, nfl, not much in college football. i am a huge volunteering/helping others advocate, anything that gives back i am all over it. i enjoy eating out, trying new types of foods, and then the best part is recreating it at home, obviously its like 10 times better. i love touristy stuff, you checking out museums and local hot spots, and since i just moved to sf, definitely something i have been active in. i enjoy hiking, and anything outdoors, camping and fishing, yes i know how to bait a hook, and no i am not scared. animals...love dogs, i will go to a shelter or pet store just to play with the puppies, they r soo cute. i listen to all types of music... from jazz to rock, hip hop to classical, if it sounds good, i'll listen to it. i like checking out new bands or even local bands. laughing is very important, but not hard for me to do...hehe. i like to read.. mostly mysteries and autobiographies. if you have any recommendations, let me know! i love movies! i will watch anything...i don't have a favorite because i even like the bad ones. i love romantic comedies, and chick flicks of course. i enjoy watching sports and thriller movies. most importantly-- my family and friends, they mean the world to me! as long as they are happy, i am =)  i am looking for... someone who i connect with on many levels. i want a man would is dedicated, intelligent, funny, compassionate, and loyal. family and friends must be important to them. they should possess good morals and values. someone who is respectful and understanding. someone who doesn't mind being silly and being themselves. i just want to meet a great guy that i can have fun with =) and as long as there is chemistry, and i am always laughing, we are all good!!"
588,"i am, without a doubt, an old soul. that doesn't mean i'm lame or boring, i think its more about the way i carry myself. i like a nice mix of doing nothing but enjoying good company or getting out there and seeing/doing it all!"
589,"these things seem strange to write about for yourself, but here goes:  i was raised in the city that's nicknamed the armpit of california, so living here is refreshing to say the least. i've been working at a bay area non profit for a few years and do a lot of performance and contract reporting. i really enjoy the work and am planning to go to business school in the next few years and continue working in nonprofit management / social venture capitalism.  aside from work, i find a fair amount of time to hang out with friends and family in the area. i love day trips, board games, hiking, tennis, poker, and good quotes.  i want to travel a lot this year and argentina has been on my list for way too long. when i was younger, i used to refuse to learn how to cook and now i'm realizing what a crazy mistake that was so every now and then, i'll try a new recipe and see how edible it is...."
590,"[*before contacting me, please read the addendum at the bottom of my profile.]  who am i? i - am originally from the south, but grew up in asia - have worked in the wine industry; publishing industry (writing and editing); have been on tv and radio - conversely, have also worked construction, landscaping, building and/or cleaning latrines, and administered basic medical care to residents of the garbage dump communities in the philippines - love to dress to the nines and go out, as well as pull my hair up and spend a day in sweats - am easily at home in a dive bar and a five-star restaurant - have been called elegant and beautiful, as well as goofy and girl-next-door - love to read, research, and problem-solve - was a beekeeper, a chicken-wrangler, grew my own food for years, and was a biodiesel brewer and monger - brew beer - smile and laugh. a lot  i also - am passionate about people - love to listen and share - am compassionate and understanding - practice forgiveness - find the hardest, but most important journey to be the one that travels inward - am loyal, honest and supportive to a fault, and have many lifelong friends - succeed often in endeavors, and am consistently fallible, too - seem to have a knack for getting myself into and (thankfully) out of messes - forever seek out new things to learn or learn from  i - miss the traveling i did in my childhood - miss the built-in excuse to play  with legos, barbies; fly kites, read aloud, and play card games  that came easily when my children were young - am both creative and logical - am out-going and shy - am silly and deeply sincere - gravitate toward the sun, but also relish the darkness - must have a creative outlet that feeds my soul  be it singing, music, painting, yoga, dance  ultimately, i'm complex just like everyone else, which makes it difficult to do an initial introduction in writing.  who are you? there's no way of articulating what i'm looking for in someone, but i am finally old enough to not settle for anything short of a mutually respectful, supportive, and loving relationship  be it a friendship or a lifelong romance. just as important for me: someone with a wicked sense of humor, a willingness to take some risks, spontaneity, and a healthy and fun balance of living in the light and the shadows.  reach out; touch, if you'd like to continue the conversation.  *wait! before you click that ""send"" button, some pointers about what i'm looking for... and not looking for: if you're looking for a quick hook-up, to sext, or want me to tell you specifics about my sexuality, you're barking up the wrong tree. move along. if you're here to get yourself out there, meet people, find collaborators in business or partners in (fun!) crime, experience new things, and maybe (or maybe not) find a deeper connection, then we're on the same page. by all means, drop me a note and say 'hi.' i'd be happy to hear from you."
591,"i love people and life....smile my great passion in life is dancing. my second passion is finding ways to awaken humanity to itself. a third passion is the beautiful game (aka football, futbol, fussball, calcio, soccer, etc.) played by beautiful people all over this big beautiful ball we call earth.  i am the youngest of five children. my parents brought us up to be interesting and interested people. my mother was my first best friend and taught me how to be a friend, along with many other things. we remained good friends until she lost her third battle with cancer a few years ago.  when i was eleven my family moved from orange county to marin county and i had intrastate culture shock which led to a series of epiphanies. this early philosophical awakening created a very intense non-conformist who has never stopped questioning everything, but never-the-less loves to have fun (learning is fun, yes?) and can always find inner peace dancing.  we are all co-creators of our mutual reality and now is the time to call out the all the bs we have co-created to date and begin co-creating the world we really want to live in. many are already doing this in their/our own way.  we are on the verge of some very great changes, brothers and sisters, now is not the time to hide and let others make decisions for you. everyone has something to contribute, large and small, many do not even know it yet.  returning to the mundane....i studied international relations and economics at university and then worked as an electrician for two decades....go figure. i have two college-age daughters (not mundane) who i love very much.  i also love to cook and prefer conversation to consumption.  [finally, for those who may find this information important, i have not had a bank account in years and stopped filing/paying federal income taxes after the supreme court selected g.w. bush (p)resident in 2001 ( the irs stopped harassing me about four years ago, btw). federal income taxes on individuals have always been voluntary, they just go to great lengths to make you think you are statutorily required to fund their ever more corrupt madness.]  be well and enjoy the day!  the truth shall set us free. love is the only way forward."
592,"i'm pretty down to earth and happy with my life, and i'm looking for someone to share it with.  i've been around the country and ventured out into the rest of the world, but i'm a cali girl at heart. i love the people here, the fantastic food, and the gorgeous scenery.  i'm originally from miami and have done a number of things in my life, building guitars, studying architecture and making/going to school for jewelry and metal arts. i've always enjoyed good food, but especially since i've moved to the bay area i've been experimenting in the kitchen more. this has landed me in the organic food community. i must admit, i've become pretty spoiled here, especially in the last couple years that i've been working at farmers markets. there's always something yummy to eat or preserve for later.  in what little free time i have these days, i like to go explore the bay area wilderness..or just relax at home. i might be in the kitchen saving produce from going bad (jams, mustards, candies etc). one of my favorite social activities is making dinner for friends/family.  i'm not your typical girl. i'm intelligent, curious, creative, sweet, kind, outgoing, relaxed, happy, friendly, drama-free, strong willed, passionate, honest, loyal, considerate and moms like me. i really like science, design, crafts, and sexy machines/tools. i can be the girly girl, dressed nicely with painted toes and lingerie, and also the one who gets in the mud to fix something. i'm not afraid of catching spiders or snakes...most snakes anyways. i'll be the one to give you a massage out of the blue, and bake you your favorite cookie just because i feel like it..or because you asked me to. i like to touch and be touched, and i'm looking for the sort of relationship where we can be comfortable either out doing something or just cuddling in front of the tv."
593,"i am still wildly passionate about life with lots of marvelous stories about adventures lived. i'm looking forward to making more memories and finding a partner/lover to share them. i am adventurous, passionate and sensual, fun and silly as well as soulful and serious. i am big hearted, compassionate, intellectual, elegant, even keeled, creative, artistic (and some say multi-talented).i am a great nature lover and lover of all the arts; visual, musical and theatrical. i am an experienced world traveler with a wish list of places to travel a mile long.i love to cook and create magic with laughter, beauty and creativity. i love weaving and telling stories from life experience that entertain. i am a warm, authentic lover of life . you are creative and intelligent, comfortable socially, playful and financially stable, kind, strong, courageous and warm. come find me for friendship, adventure and fun."
594,"i'm passionate, assertive, lighthearted, honest to a fault, loyal, and fiercely liberal. huge fan of oldschool country music, going to dinner with friends, singing in the car, sunday walks, falling asleep with a great book (usually non-fiction with a sprinkle of a new york times bestseller), and my morning cup of coffee. my life is extremely active and while i'm not a marathon runner, there's rarely a day where i'm not out doing some physical activity."
595,in progress...
596,"what do you get when you mix 1 part irish, 1 part dutch and 2 parts german? me!  my friends will tell you i'm funny and most down to earth person they know. they also say i have a calming vibe. i'm a 5 year licensed massage therapist so i'd hope i'm calming. no, i don't do happy endings! i get to help people actually heal and it's reward is much bigger on my end. my 'job' doesn't seem like much of a job, more of a way of life. i workout 3-5 times a week for health and because my job requires stamina. like i said, a way of life."
597,"i am fun to be around, always curious, adventurous and daring, playful and quick to tease, intelligent (when i'm not intoxicated), sensitive and caring, sensual, compassionate, low maintenance, and very easy to take home to your family and friends. really!! (well, unless the people at your house don't like women who would rather be watching the football game then making the 7 layer dip in the kitchen. but i will always pitch in when there's a need, and i'll help clean up, i promise!)  i consider myself a lifelong learner and seeker, and am always curious about everything. i am warm, expressive, inquisitive, upbeat, kind, and usually want to help people, pitch in, and do my part in group situations. but i am also slightly rebellious, like creature comforts more than i think i should, and usually run about 5 minutes late (but i'm getting better at that!). i am drawn to people i can have long, deep talks about cool things with, but i usually find something interesting and/or redeeming about almost every person i meet. i am constantly growing as a person, and believe that takes self-awareness, openness, courage, the wisdom of trusted friends, and shaking things up every once in a while.  one of my friends once teased me by calling me the blondest brunette he knows. although i could take life too seriously and get defensive about that, i choose to see it as a sort of compliment to my friends - i am so comfortable around them, i let my guard down completely, don't mind acting like a fool, and stream-of-consciousness-style talk before i think. hence the clueless-sounding crap that comes out of my mouth sometimes. but it's great entertainment, i swear! if nothing else, i end up laughing at myself, and, well, at least someone's having fun at my expense, right? ;)  i work in the environmental field (biological resource management and planning). play consists of sports (ultimate, swimming, running, kickboxing, beach/paddle tennis, and trying tons of other things i am not yet good at), games - i love games - (shooting pool, playing poker/cards, backgammon, sudoku/puzzles), watching sports or games, creative/artistic endeavors (including cooking), dinners and conversations with friends, live music and dancing, and enjoying down time just listening to all the sounds around me. i have a favorite simple 'game' i play when i am relaxing, where i try to count all the distinct sounds i can hear at once. it's like separating out the soundtrack of life around you.  i'm a bay area native, was gone (in la - but i think i managed to return relatively intact) for 20 years, and just moved to the city about a year ago. it's weird experience, because it's kind of like coming 'home,' but to a new place (the city versus the south bay). and so far, i love it! what a cool city..."
598,"is this possibility the reality you wish to create?  walking a cobblestone street (somewhere near or far) to where you've been lured, you feel happy for (even though you've been swayed away from work you love) in your arm is the woman you adore and who adores you. together, you smile and laugh feeling both pleasure and contentment to be in each other's company. your shared curiosity, explorers' spirit, good humor and zeal for the outdoors make traveling and simply living every-day life together a delight. her paradoxical qualities both bewilder and enchant you. smiling, you recall when you first met. her unassuming style, pretty smile, authenticity, physical charms and whimsical tendencies distracted you from the full depth and intricacies of her total person. still, her charisma and the emotion you felt baffled you and compelled you to pursue and, much to your good fortune, win her attentions and affection. in doing so, you pleasantly discovered her youthful, sexy, fanciful, nave, affable qualities in coexistence with her courageous, mature, intellectual character unafraid to speak her mind that challenges and inspires you to be your better self. analogous to you, she also loves adventure and has developed eclectic-sophisticated predilections for music, the arts and the fine distinct things and pleasure of life which she enjoys. yet, she fancies simple pleasures and beauty as much as fine things and is a humble, sensible person who doesn't require or allow status symbols to define her and who endeavors to make a difference in the world. like you, she is not perfect but she holds herself to high standards, has a strong sense of responsibility, and demonstrates a notable level of emotional maturity and stability. in this way, she is her own person. no matter the modern day craze, peer pressure or life struggles, she consistently strives to live a life with intention and in harmony with her old-fashion values and fundamental nature. in like manner, she strives to be more spiritual than religious both attending sunday mass and chanting for world peace (calls herself zen-catholic). her flexible, calm nature and open mind help you feel at ease and free to share your deepest thoughts, ideas and life dreams without fear of judgment or rejection of you as a person. her loyalty and dedication to family and friends and her love of children mirrors that of yours and when things get too crazy she reminds you to stop and smell the flowers and that, ultimately, the memories and the kind of relationships we build with our family and friends are what matter most. as your years together pass like days, you continue to discern new aspects of her intricate spirit and like that she is still a lady who welcomes and embraces your thoughtful respectful, gentleman attentions. in settle yet passionate ways, her sensual femininity defines your masculinity and provokes you in ways that still stir and surprise you as she encourages and surrenders to you gracefully accepting your generous, affectionate overtures with delight and reciprocity. enigmatic as she may seem, she is real. no doubt more intelligent, more physically attractive women exist and certainly all is not perfect or without effort. but (for you and with you) she is unlike any other. no matter her imperfections or occasional blunders (and awful off-note singing--lol) with her, life seems to have more meaning, more purpose, more pleasure, more passion, more joy, more contentment and more serenity...  if this narrative represents what your heart desires and if you personify the implied characteristics of this gentleman, i invite you to send me a note. just never know ... ;-)"

609,"about me... hmm, i live in berkeley, california. (even so, i'm a republican. i do have a lot of conservative values, though not 100%. i'm adding this because many people assume i'm very liberal just because i live in berkeley. maybe if i'd lived somewhere like texas, iowa, or the east coast, i'd have had an easier time of meeting someone i'm compatible with.)  my former beau died of cancer almost two years ago, he was only 52 years old. so i'm kinda lonely.  i've lived quite an adventurous life, beginning with joining the air force at 19. i've seen a lot of the word. i lived in london & paris... i'm a europhile, francophone.  i enjoy the simple things like just grocery shopping & making a meal with someone special. i'm from the east bay but have seen much of the us... loved the south, nyc, and places in between.  *my hobbies include gardening, travel, reading, movies...  *a nice date might be going to the zoo (oakland, i'm a member), going on safari (they have one in sonoma california!), maybe going to the rennaisance faire. too, i often enjoy walking along the alameda beach.  *i prefer warm weather to cool, sacramento would be preferable to san francisco for a place to live.  *as far as dining out... i like a view! i'm not into fancy restraunts... often i'd prefer a picnic. of late i'm into health foods... i do still eat chicken, fish, & some red meat. my late beau had a problem with alcohol, so i decided to give up drinking altogether. (i don't mind if someone drinks occasionally, but i'd just rather not be drinking these days.)  *some people have described me as aristocratic, i'm 4th generation in california and i've spent time living in london and paris. i have met some royalty... it was cool!!!  still, i've also been daddy's little girl & enjoyed working on houses, driving a truck/ & bus, using power tools, and going to the dump. i especially like bmws & any kind of truck, especially with a lumber rack on it. i drive a subaru wagon these days.  *i spent many years in school. studies included: math-science, french, art-history-architecture, psychology (organizational behavior), & i have an rn licence, a real estate licence, & a commercial driver's licence (i drove a tour bus in san francisco for a time). work in tourism got me back to paris a half a dozen times (paid!) and i enjoyed using my french here for visitors from around the worldl.  * i enjoy a person who likes people, has a sense of humor, and can go to a morrocan restraunt & the theater or the dump and enjoy them equally... a night in with a bbc mystery is also cool!!!  * i enjoy antiques, had an antique business for a short time... * i never married (came close a number of times), no kids, but i like children, small & grown, as well as cats and dogs.  **** guess that's quite a bit about me, for starters... contact me if you'd like to meet and live within a reasonable distance. thx, sa*"

636,"feminine is the best way to describe me, from my mannerisms, to my curves, to my style of dress. i am more comfortable in skirts then jeans, but i do own a pair or two. i only wear sneakers when i exercise. my worst habit is my addiction to lipstick, but don't panic my lipstick is organic!  i am a positive, kind, social, compassionate woman and i am loving life. i am eclectic and that is reflected in how i think, who i am friends with, my spiritual beliefs and the music i listen to.  i believe that we are here to learn, to love and to laugh! life is a school for souls and we are all students.  i derive great joy from many things in my life. i like helping people become aware of developing eco-friendly practices. another thing that brings me joy is music. music sets my soul free. writing is something i discovered in the last few years and i am working on writing a book. i have many, many, deep, caring, friendships and i value spending time with my friends and family.  i am looking for a man who is healthy in body, mind and spirit. a gentleman ( a gentle man) who has the soul of an artist and the heart of a poet and the spirit of a sage. he needs to be loving life and not looking for happiness to happen once he meets a woman.  and, if i am really honest, i have to admit that how a man dresses can be a turn on or a turn off for me. i am not into crocs or birkenstocks, especially when worn with socks. i think i may have a shoe fetish, so a man wearing a nice pair of shoes catches my eye. well fitted jeans and shirts, really do it for me and a man in a nice suit oh baby! not a must but i am just saying"
637,"i'm pretty simple! down to earth, can have fun almost anywhere with the right company. must love dogs as i have a 25lb lab/skipperke that is here to stay. love most things outdoors. i'm a huge gs warriors fan even though i know they suck. i'm pretty girlie but not at all snotty or uptight. i can be really goofy and somewhat sarcastic but know when enough is enough. confidence is important on both ends(not arrogance) as well as a good heart! would love to settle down with someone i consider my best friend! definitely having the same likes in life is a great plus and the differences are an added bonus of intrigue. i enjoy working out, being outside and road trips! i have a heart of gold and sometimes have a hard shell but i can also wear my feelings on my sleeve! speaking of... i do have a full sleeve on my left arm and a half sleeve on the other so... hopefully that wont scare anyone off... they're in good taste and i plan on naybe getting some more work done in the future so...  first date i will know when we meet...depends on the chemistry but whatever we do it will be where we can talk, hang out and get to know each other. i don't know why people say go to the movies...not much more awkward than sitting in the dark with someone you don't know...right? lol"
638,"i suck at writing these. lets start by saying im a deep and thoughtful person, and im definitely the relationship type. im 6'2 and people always want me to reach things for them. i like to travel, and i like to try new things (except skydiving). my joys in life include making money in creative ways."
639,"hey there!  i am a native californian (grew up in small agricultural town) who loves adventures in the bay area and beyond. i am happy with where i am in life  but it would be so much more fun if you were in it with me!  i don't take myself too seriously and life is way too short to sweat the small stuff. but, relationships with my friends and family are extremely important to me. i am a dedicated family member and friend with a lot of love to give! i am genuine, sincere, and truly care about others. i will always ask about your day, and will want to hear all about it. i think honesty is the best policy and communication is key. i do my best to live a drama free life (other than the occasional reality tv show!).  exploring is a passion of mine. i've been lucky to see places across the globe  snorkeling the great barrier reef and driving the coast of ireland are some of my favorite experiences. but, local history is a passion of mine too, so you will find me exploring local museums or historical sites, and i always stop to read about places/things from the past. i am always down to take the road less traveled just to see where it goes.  oh, i am a total local news and politics junkie (undergrad degree is in political science). i only like to talk about the same in a friendly way, though.  2012 is about being healthy. i get up crazy early during the week and go to boot camp. it's the hardest thing physically that i've ever done. but there is something exhilarating about exercising outside along the beach in the morning to start the day off right  then i can have fun after workmaybe with you!"

644,"poster-child for the american melting pot. grandparents from 4 countries on 3 continents. parents are the equivalent of matter and anti-matter in every way imaginable, except in that they're both really good people. grew up back east, transplanted here in 2000.  i'm a tomboy who loves power tools, pretty clothes, and intelligent conversation about nearly anything. i spend my time and money on experiences more than on things - a weekend camping with friends is so much more attractive to me than a flat-screen tv and 500 channels to numb my brain. down to dance all night, hit some east bay hiking trails, or talk about what a masculinist movement would be like.  i've had some great experiences in my life. i've traveled quite a bit (mostly solo and usually rural): thailand, india, azerbaijan, italy, france, turkey, ethiopia, eritrea, haiti. someday, i'll make it south of the border! i lived for a few years in mendocino county on a 36-foot schoolbus that i converted into a cozy cabin of sorts. (it was amazing, but i don't know that i ever want a home on wheels again!)  i live as simply as i can. i ride my bike or walk most places, enjoy a soak in our solar-heated hot tub most evenings, and spend a lot of time with my beautiful, soulful friends. lest i be mistaken for a hippie - i love all things pork, don't smoke weed, bathe regularly, and there's not a stitch of tie-dye in my closet.  i dream of someday having a sweet little home in a sweet little urban neighborhood with a sweet ginormous community garden and at least a dozen (mostly other people's) children running through my house and yard on a regular basis. i want a modern urban village, and a tightknit community, and a family to share in it."

655,"i'm jack. i'm originally from canada. i'm sorry.  i studied criminology and psychology in university in vancouver, and yet somehow ended up down here in san francisco in the video games industry. i've been here five years now, which is apparently long enough to extinguish any trace of an accent.  i grew up on a farm, but i've always been pretty urban. i think the major thing that rubbed off on me is that i'm less afraid of wolves than i probably should be."
656,"i am jealous of good nappers i like cough drops i hate emptying dishwashers my grandmother used to say i was a catch i am easily talked into fun i like filling dishwashers my friends range from 23 to 40, so i rarely act my age. i have favorite commercials  honestly i have the world by the balls. i have a good job, i live in a great city, i come from a good family, i am moderately awesome, wise, and fun loving. really the only thing i am looking for is someone with that rare triple crown of pretty, smart, and kind."

669,"hi there, just finished grad school at berkeley, and started a fantastic job in the city. my work has about 90% of my attention right now, so i'm not sure what i'm looking for in terms of a relationship, but this seems like an ideal place to meet other busy people who still want to cram in the occasional happy hour date or weekend rock climbing excursion."

(ask me about the story of the sheep onboard the boat.... and how we got the sheep off the boat.) i am banned from riding a moped in two countries. i have made a traditional american feast on the african savanna over an open bonfire with nothing but some chopped beef and a machete.  i have not yet ventured into central america or asia much yet, but i hope to change that soon! also, i have always traveled alone.  i am ""a bit"" adventurous. i like to travel, planned or not, spur of the moment or not. i can hop on a flight to anywhere with no plans and be just fine. and i've done it. and i don't mean to kansas. i mean to munich, zurich, or prague. when i flew to africa, i flew in without a plan and without knowing anyone. ended up living with a tribe and a rural preacher man and practicing emergency pediatric medical care out in the savanna and the wastes. one of the best experiences of my life.  edit: personality wise, i am no longer a dead split between an estp and an istp. i am a full-fledged istp. http://www.personalitypage.com/istp.html  i enjoy the great outdoors - hiking, camping, backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, skiing, snowboarding, swimming, caving, spelunking, exploring, etc. i like to be active.  i'm always dreaming about doing more. what can i do more? how can i help more? i like to volunteer and i have a huge desire to go back to school and get into the medical field (nurse, pa, something). one day, i'd like to practice high level medicine overseas. help out in places that need it most.  i am also a total nerd. give me some captain america, iron man, batman, or watchman any day. go avengers! love the movie and love the comic series. i was raised on the transformers and they'll always have a very special place in my heart. hardcore scifi rocks my world  heinlein, asimov, bradbury, etc. star trek vs star wars? i can't decide. i was raised on both. there are, however, only three star wars movies. only. three.  i am not a gamer myself, but i can enjoy watching people play games. i like the immersive experience, though due to my background in the government/military, i sometimes avoid the hyper realistic shooters. dead space and halo rock. i haven't yet watched anyone play mass effect, to which i am told my life is woefully incomplete.  i am a christian and a devout believer in science. i marry the two together for a deeper and richer understanding of reality. can they be two sides of the same coin? studying and keeping up with emerging theories in quantum mechanics is one of my hobbies.  i am also a writer (both non-fiction and pop fiction). i'm working on several more little things, all in the adventure/sci-fi/military realm. recently i've become interested in branching out into a post-apocalyptic genre. or zombies.  i work out regularly and keep myself very well in shape.  i love sports. i enjoy watching and playing, especially football. yes, playing football. i joined an amateur men's tackle football league in texas and played cb and safety. it was an amazing experience. i have a (small) scar on my face from the helmet, a scar on my shoulder from my shoulder pads, a healing crushed nerve in my elbow, and newly recovered torn quads in both legs. i almost broke my nose. my boss begged me to quit. i persevered. i made great tackles. :)  i am not a tree-hugging hippie."
755,"i'm living in a world of funployment, doing anything and everything that involves no stress, fun and a lot of alcohol. the curative value of funployment, to me, is that it keeps me busy. in my normal life, in the outside world, i seldom have anything to do from morning til night and i simply wander about. a writer who rarely writes, lonely and at peace, getting through the day cunningly.  but once i'm in funployment, the nights and days are crowded with tiny events and tiny accomplishments. breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with the rest of my hours spent subsistng in a semi-starved condition, like man in a lifeboat. and when my stomach is empty, my mind and soul are full and i'm up and about, doing housework, catching up on correspondence, outwitting the bunnies, picking up after myself, fighting the shades with that one broken spring, making plans for life, making plans for death, making dodges to avoid getting a job, prying into the private lives of bartenders, and gazing out at the wheeling planets and lovely arabesques of san francisco. busyness is really the solution to a man's life, in this cold, sunless clime."
756,"oy! this is always the sucky part of any online whatcha-ma-callits...me, huh? well, in high school, i was dubbed 80s guy because i liked the 80s. go figure. i'm silly, a goof-ball, can be ""weird"" at some times, am kinda a nerd, and yeah. yeah, and i work at one of the ever-multiplying apple stores. college came around, and i became a normal person, toning down the 80sness, though i do still enjoy the culture.  i am a recent college grad in electronic media from sfsu and live near by. what do i want to do with my diploma you may ask?? oh, if only i knew! radio? tv? voice-over-ing would probably ideal....still working on that, though...  i always enjoy meeting new people, and i think that's what life's all about. whether it be friends, a nice nsa situation, or something more, chances are, i'd be up for it. ;-)  i am humorous, random, and eccentric"
757,"i was born and raised in the east bay. i am loyal, honest, and dependable. i like lots of activities and love living life. want to know more? just ask."
758,"-i like popping in the earbuds and listening to music when my feet hit the pavement in transit. life looks like a music video whatever i view.  -i am a hot sauce and mustard junkie. you'll find a dedicated row in my fridge.  -have a car but prefer to walk to most places if i can. hiking bass lake to the coast is a new favorite destination.  -i've been known to go to concerts/movies/dinner by myself if none of my friends want to go out that night. i have a pretty good time still.  -grew up in chicago, lived in vancouver bc for post college education, bay area is where i call home now.  -i'm close with my family. i have old parents for my age and am the youngest of 4 brothers. i feel very lucky that we all get along. getting older changes things for the better, problem is everyone is getting older faster.  -i try to be practical with what i'm buying and not pile up too much crap. but when i get a little more space and permanence where i live, there's going to be some serious record buying going on. i may just start getting a serious national geographic stack going.  -i hold up well in any crowd usually, but don't like bars/clubs where people scream directly at your face. that's what concerts are for and i gladly paid for that.  -i wouldn't call myself a foodie and am not the kind to take pictures of my meal and yelp about it. i do like what a good restaurant can do for a night with friends and family having a little culinary adventure. i have no problem if bourbon just happens to land in my mouth too.  -i am only marginally world traveled and am looking forward to giving a big fat check off the list some major euro spots in these next 2 years. so far only london, scotland, canada and trekking across the u.s have been done.  -i am right handed but play guitar lefty. also am ambidextrous when eating. i know, right?!"
759,"practical. analytical. friendly. assertive. goofy. i'm looking for someone sincere, easy to share a laugh with, knows how to be present with other people, goal-oriented, and values accountability. i love it when people freely express and share their thoughts. i love to make plans. i feel like i connect best with people that are organized, actively engage in conversations, respect differences, and act with integrity. it's important for me to feel a sense of friendship, as well as, a strong emotional and physical connection."
760,"i'm friendly, laid back, free spirited, fun, ambitious, down to earth, creative, non-judmental, silly, sensual, sweet, alliteration-prone, loyal, proudly nerdy, culturally curious, resilient, a travel-holic, a compulsive high-five'r, a try-anything-once'r, a hopeless romantic... i go with the flow and welcome being taken out of my comfort zone for fun, new experiences.  i'm the chick on the dance floor who you just did the running man with despite our being complete strangers; someone who can comfortably bike to a solo brunch or brunch with a crowded table of friends; the person everyone calls for advice; the stranger you can have a deep, possibly vulnerable conversation with as if we've long been friends; the driver next to you at a red light bumpin' wiz khalifa, band of horses, npr or phil collins (don't judge me, i like soft rock); a girl you can take home to mom or, hey, just stay home with... ;)  the bay is home for me, just moved back after 6 years in ny. i live in oakland, work in the city. i'm looking to date, meet new people and do new things - grab drinks at a great new bar, go rock climbing on a 2nd date, enjoy a nice convo over tea with a new guy, form a crush on someone i'd normally never cross paths with, meet a cool new friend... maybe even meet my life partner."
761,"i am funny, honest (sometimes to honest) loyal and like to keep active. i can be sarcastic but not nasty. i like to laugh and joke around and not take things to serious."
762,i will fill in my profile later.
763,"i'm a bay area native from the peninsula -- i've lived in san francisco now for about 2 years and loving it.  i keep busy and don't get out often.  during my spare time i like to: cook, read, and surf the web :)"
764,"it's coming up on a year now since i left the east coast with a b.s. in electrical engineering to start a new job. now i live in san francisco, loving it's amazing produce, weird people and cavalier attitude towards hedonism.  i was born and raised in western/central massachusetts, then went to college in a boston suburb. my parents sit at a strange intersection of techy and hippy, so a bizarre combination of folk concerts, science museums and pet goats made me the way i am. i sometimes miss ma, and definitely feel like i have roots there, but on the whole i'm overjoyed to be on this coast and hope to stay put.  i live in the castro and work in tech, so meeting women is hard. hell, making friends who aren't engineers would be great too. this profile tends to fluctuate in and out of existence when i get frustrated trying to find common ground in contrived self summaries. so let's get coffee/drinks/food in a well lit public place and maximize the potential for awkward blind date stories."
765,"hello, my name is anthony. i'm twenty-six years old. i'm funny, friendly, good natured, kind and a compassionate person. physically i'm tall and naturally muscular. don't work out regularly but enjoy outdoor activities. i'm a pretty laid back person, easy to get along with. not into drugs, drink socially, and don't smoke cigarettes but smoke 420, lol."
766,"i grew up in small town wyoming. (not that you really give a fuck.) i've lived in ca for 12 years 2 of them in san francisco. (not that i really give a fuck.) i'm very laid back and like the simple things in life. (do i have a pulse?) i'm down-to-earth, good-natured, and pride myself in being honest and dependable. (how freaking californian can i get?)  i am dynamic, innovative, and empathetic"
767,"my vestigial adjectives from ok cupid profiles past... i am independent, opinionated, and happy  i'm generally low key. i like to spend time in coffee shops to read or to get some work done. i prefer american coffee or espresso but i will buy a latte if they make artwork in the foam. if you want to grab a cup of coffee and talk politics (or any other controversial issue) i'm game. there is nothing i enjoy more than a good argument, and i respect those who have opinions over those who don't (whether they agree with me or not).  i love books, movies, and even tv, though i work a lot and don't get as much time with them as i'd like. good literature provides good ethics and life philosophy. i believe the we are at our best when we are like characters in a book; we struggle through faults and failures (and only occasionally successes) that define who we are and lead to new adventures. p.s., a desirable life should imitate good art, and romance --for a night or for a year-- should be like it is in books and movies (at least like it is in the good books and movies).  coffee and books aside i need to get out, i have a nagging spirit of adventure. i've been practicing a never say no attitude to trips to the outdoors or trips out in downtown oakland or san francisco. i enjoy biking, running (training for a marathon now), swimming (even in the bay), and hiking. i also like to go out dancing though not super often as i mostly just humiliate myself, and, of course, beer.  about my history, i'm originally from buffalo, ny and am a bills fan at heart. i then spent five years in pittsburgh, pa where i earned my bachelors. i never say no to an interesting opportunity so i've spent summers in brazil and wyoming, and more then one summer in washington d.c. i have never been across an ocean, but i'm looking forward to it. i like taking classes a bit too much and hopefully will find myself learning new material for the rest of my life. whether i will be doing that learning in a university is to be determined.  i come from a very large and very close italian/lebanese extended family. however none of them live in the area so i've been creating a new family while i'm here! i'm looking forward to making a new group of friends in the bay area whom i can rely on way to much."
768,"i am easy going, funny (at least i think so), perhaps a little bit arrogant but i can laugh at myself and don't take myself too seriously. occasionally obnoxious, boredom is my enemy so i sometimes stir up trouble for some entertainment.  i have a good career that lets me do the things i like to do and takes me to a lot of interesting places. i lived in amsterdam for 5 years, moved back home to australia for a couple of years then got a job offer here in ca. i have moved around a lot in the last 10 years but i think i have finally found my place to settle down."
769,"you're in luck if we happen to be together when the following situations arise...  1. we're at dinner and you forgot your wallet (i'll either spot you and/or wash the dishes with you).  2. you suddenly feel like clogging up your arteries with something fatty, or have a craving for starchy, sugary, and salty foods (this is the point where i take you to my favorite filipino restaurant).  3. you feel like telling somebody about the time when you were little and your pet bird passed away, and how you never really quite recovered...  4. we're at one of those behemoth movie theaters and you suddenly feel like seeing 2-3 more movies right after the one we just saw.  5. we're having coffee or beer and you begin to ponder all of the world's grand contradictions.  6. you feel like telling really corny jokes and have someone laugh with you or you feel like laughing at my corny jokes.  7. you have a new crazy idea that you want to develop and need another human being crazy enough to be your accomplice.  8. you suddenly had an epiphany about your life and want to celebrate at happy hour over 1/2 priced umbrella drinks (i do love epiphanies).  9. you had one of those really weird days and want someone to commiserate with.  10. you're having one those moments where you can't figure out whether you want to laugh or cry.  i am lively, eclectic, and genuine"

771,i would like the weather to warm up so i can use that prescription scuba mask swimming at baker beach.
772,"love anything outdoors or in nature. i'm a musician and always lookin for someone to jam with. currently awaiting to begin school, major in archaeology. fascinated by ancient history and i crave knowledge. i'm a skater and well attuned with my body and mind - love exercise and athletics. enjoy most all types of music, prefer thrash metal and punk. favorite bands are primus and parliament.  enjoy conversation, especially one-on-one, or deep/abstract subject matter. love backpacking, fishing, hiking, partyin' and goin to shows"
773,"truth be told, the world is much more interesting when shared with someone. nothing revelatory there, but just to say that i'd really enjoy getting to know someone thoughtful and interesting, whether as friends or on a date.  in our hectic world i try to find enough time to really experience things, and take time to think. rushing around isn't the answer. i'd much rather keep a steady pace.  sorry there isn't a picture. i'll send one if i contact you (in which i will be fully clothed). and, please excuse the lame name. i was trying to see if okcupid was worth the bother and you ladies have convinced me it could be..."
774,"i'm so terrible at these things but i'll give it a shot...  i just recently moved out into a very nice house in san leandro with some friends. i'm enjoying living on the east bay thus far and my house mates kick ass!  i'm a bit of a workaholic, i love my job and my job loves me, it goes hand in hand i suppose.  i live for riding my motorcycle, i do it as often as possible.  my room is always clean and smells like febreeze.  i brush my teeth in the shower.  i eat ramen noodles at least 2-3 times a week.  i listen to a few bands constantly, they don't ever seem to get old.  i try to live spontaneously. i'll never think twice at the opportunity to do something out of the box. random day trips are great!  i love to travel and to try new things. i feel that the only way to live life to the fullest is to not put anything past yourself. how can you know if you don't like something if you don't jump in and try it?  i enjoy going to shows a lot! if i like a band, i'm going to see them every chance i get!  skydiving is next on my bucket list.  i just realized after going over my whole profile i never included what exactly i was looking for. i'm looking for something real. someone whose down to hangout at home or go out with friends. someone to spend time with who is funny or at least laughs at my terribly rude and/or sarcastic jokes. who laughs at her mistakes and confident enough to give herself props on her accomplishments... you hopefully!"
775,"i'm a practicing logician and contrarian. my standard days tend to be filled with film, reading, gardening and soccer. ready to give into the traveling bug. i constantly assume people are older than i am.  self summarization makes me twitch."
776,"hi! i'm mike and i capitalize the first letter of proper nouns.  i moved to san francisco from calgary (canada). i'm a college student here in the city. most of my time gets spent drawing, making music or napping. i'm really quite nerdy, i enjoy comics, reddit, video games, zombie movies, boardgames, and reading books."
777,"self summaries always are hard for me.  i'm an east coast transplant who has been living in san francisco since 2007. i'm pretty laid back, and i love to explore the city whenever i get the chance.  i'm a pretty creative person, as i've been drawing or doing some sort of art ever since i could hold a pencil. when i'm not doing that i like to explore san francisco, party with my friends, go on walks/bike rides or just relax and watch a movie or play video games. i'm pretty laid back and it doesn't take a whole lot to keep me amused."
778,"i am an ambitious guy. i strive for the best, and i consider myself a hard worker. i graduated nursing school in the end of 2011, and been working as a licensed nurse for several months now, doing my best putting in hours and learning a lot. i've always had a passion for helping people. i enjoy going to art and science museums, i love absorbing new information, especially if its related to the human body. i am a unofficial health nut, i devote a lot of time going to the gym, and caring for my 3 doggies and taking them out for a walk near the beach. i'm a good listener, even if i don't know anything about the subject i tend to become intrigued and motivated to learn more about the subject.  i used to be known as a really good artist, but it's a lot harder to find the time to sit and draw or paint now. i'm big on exploring new areas, learning about a really beautiful scenic places, or finding a not to well known restaurant. i'm always trying to learn new recipes because i love to cook. i love to laugh, especially when it has to do with sarcasm, awkward situations, and corny one liners. i've been to a few comedy shows and wish to go more often. i am sometimes hard on myself because i have high expectations, and i try to stay on a life path that allows me to improve as a man. continuous small improvements in life, having an open mind and trying new things is what i'm pursuing right now in life. also haven't done much traveling, but i would like to do a lot more road trips and flying to different places around the world."
779,"what can i really say? i am always looking for new experiences in life, and prefer to take things slow and as they come. that doesn't mean i don't plan things out or can go things in a hurry because i sure can when things pile up.  usually not too worried about things i can't change, and am told that i am unusually accepting of many things. i consider myself to have a great personality, even if it doesn't show right away. i tend to mind my own business but when it matter, i can be quite dependable.  right now i am taking life as it comes, taking my time with it. still in college but nothing wrong with that right? one of those people not willing to take the last step and getting a job in this economy. so why not live it up and try to get another year of college learning done? :d  i am cheerful, intelligent, and witty"
780,
781,"i'm an east-coast transplant, but i've been in oakland for 10 yrs now, so it's definitely home to me.  i am passionate about staying physically active, supporting my friends, learning new things, and bettering myself. i love soccer and hope to get back to it as soon as i can. i did triathlon for a few years and will one day get back to that, but it really sucks up all your time and becomes your life. for now, running suffices.  philosophically, i don't believe in instant gratification."
782,my friends has told me that i'm too nice... and too picky. lol. i guess i just like to make good decisions and no regrets.
783,
784,"i am originally from the sf bay area. i am blessed with a loving, supportive family and amazing friends. i try to spend lots of time with those close to me.  i like to keep an active healthy lifestyle. running is really important to me. i also enjoy cycling, hiking, going to gym, strength classes and always up to trying something new.  i love to travel and explore new places. my next trip is to italy, where both of my parents were born. although, i also enjoy shorter weekend trips to the mountains, wine country and the coastal cities!  i am affectionate, loyal, respectful, giving and goal oriented. i am optimistic and i am happy by nature. you will usually find me smiling!  i'm inspired by good books and people with great wisdom and spirituality.  i am looking for someone who is genuine, ambitious, supportive and open to love. i like someone who makes me laugh and likes to have fun. it's important that he enjoys the outdoors and keeping fit and healthy."
785,"i am disappointed at the lack of gender choices on this website. as a result, i often change my label (on here) between male and female. when i list myself as female, i label myself as gay because i'm sick of all the straight guys' disgusting one-liners. when i list myself as male, i label myself bisexual, but that's only partly true. to find out why, read further.  if you installed this script, you'd be able to view my profile properly. the script will force okcupid to properly display my gender identity and sexuality at the top of my profile. (for those of you using the okc app on your smartphones, there is a link there that you can only see through a web browser.)  i used to think i was a woman trapped in a man's body (transsexual), but i now realize that i just want people to treat me differently, in the body i'm in. my body isn't the problem, everybody else's perception of it is! i don't identify as either male or female. i currently define myself as intergendered, although the broader terms  genderqueer and ""non-binary gender"" also fit. my preferred pronouns are neutral ones. they, them, zi, zir, or anything similar are all fine.  i'm too femme for most straight girls to be romantically and/or sexually attracted to me, and have the wrong genitals to be enjoyed by lesbians. this usually leaves me only able to date bisexual and pansexual people. i'm totally fine with only dating these people, i only wish there were more of them, as they are a clear minority. at times, the limited selection makes my romantic life rather difficult.  i always want to be friends before being lovers. i do not do one night stands, and try my best to avoid potentially short lived relationships. that being said, most of my friends are  polyamorous, and so i tend to be polyamorish as well. i date around a lot, but what i'm really searching for is a relationship that will leave me so satisfied in and of itself that i won't feel a desire to date other people even if i still have the option to. this is something that i know is out there for me; i just need to find the right person. (if you think we'd make good, platonic friends, don't let this last paragraph keep you from writing to me!)  when i'm in a good mood, i'm generally very flirtatious. and when i do find somebody who i'm really attracted to, i have a tendency to get really giddy, which i personally rather enjoy, but it does have a tendency to make my attraction worry that things are moving too fast. it's not uncommon for me to be compared to a flirtatious school girl.  i'm at a point in my life where i can't have sex with anybody solely because i find them physically attractive. i'm almost a demisexual, except i'm just ignoring primary sexual attraction, and only looking for the secondary attraction. this is as opposed to not having primary attraction at all, like a true demisexual would. (for the definitions of demisexual, primary attraction, and secondary attraction, look here: http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=demisexual)  back in the day, the first thing okc had you fill out was three adjectives that describe you. mine are, in no particular order, queer, pragmatic, and nurturing.  i hate money with a passion. there's nothing fundamentally wrong with money, but the current system is so fucked up that it's become merely a means of keeping the people currently on top in their places of power. i'm happy making just enough to get by, but i'd be happier with a more meaningful job (i'm actively looking).  in case you noticed that my religion says, ""other and somewhat serious about it,"" and you're wondering about that, i'm a unitarian universalist. being serious about being a uu really doesn't involve that much, since the main principles of the religion say that you can believe almost anything you want. around half of us don't even believe in any deity, including myself. in short, i'm serious about peace, love, constructive debate, a constant desire to learn, and everybody getting along with everyone else.  i really am 6 feet tall, and on the skinny side of average. according to oktrends (http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating), most people lie about seemingly harmless little things, like their height, body condition, and income. i swear, to what ever it is that you believe in, that i have not told even the whitest of lies in my profile.  if you haven't figured it out yet, my strategy for creating an online dating profile is to include as much about myself as possible in one. i believe that boundless honesty is essential in forming the most meaningful relationships, and that's what i'm here for, so i'm trying to put as much out front as possible.  i used to act with cincinnati's local rocky horror picture show cast, the denton affair. shadow acting, but still lots of fun. occasionally, i think about doing more stage work. so far though, i've only thought about it. rocky horror really aided in my self discovery.  for anyone that cares, i am a cancer-leo cusp. my birthday is right smack in between the two, and you won't find more of a cusp than me. i don't really think it matters, but some people seem to think this makes me extra awesome, so i won't hold it against you if you do.  i'm a 2 on the kinsey scale, if you assume that i'm male (the kinsey scale doesn't work with non-binary genders). i'm totally not against cuddling and kissing the right kind of guy, but be aware that there will (probably) be no in-pants action going on! i suppose that this means that i am more  heteroflexible than bisexual. of course, the dilemma with this labeling is: how can i be 'heteroflexible' if i don't identify as either of the binary genders? but i have yet to find a more suitable label. the ""right kind of guy"" is, by the way, more often than not genderqueer, and effeminate, like myself."
786,"smart, creative, irreverent, loyal; and looking for a true partner who is strong enough a playful enough and wise enough to know when and how to push back when the time is right."
787,"i feel that one of my greatest strengths is my kind nature. i'm polite, respectful, and thoughtful and people seem to pick up on that right away. i think it's hard to fake sincerity and i have a genuinely big heart. doing things that makes people happy makes me happy! like anybody else, i like to laugh and have fun. i have a great sense of humor and love to kid around. on the other hand, i am serious about my work and very ambitious. i'm a firm believer in finding something you're passionate about in life and dedicating yourself to doing the best that you can in it. i worked very hard for the career i have and continue to expect the best from myself. i enjoy what i do for a living, but i also think it's important to achieve a sense of balance in your life."

795,"now that i have passed the picture phase, a little about me:  i am a great date i enjoy maintaing a healthy lifestyle, physically and mentally love my parents and the rest of my family love to trail run not afraid of commitment enjoy cooking environmentally-conscious can get passionate and heated at times during conversations, and at the same time be a good listener brew my own beer support local artisan businesses try to travel as often as possible optimistic and happy with my life, with idea that every new person and new experience adds to it i come from a good family and hold those values important comfortable in my own skin confident clean responsible with my money keep my friendships and value close relationships volunteer locally and internationally enjoy skinny dipping in all forms of water; hot springs, rivers, lakes the ocean make my coffee with a french press, it is a daily experience!  i am somewhat of an old soul when it comes to dating. i believe in showing a woman how i feel instead of just telling her. i have never cheated on a partner and i am not a game player. all the women on here that say they are hopeless romantics, well i too believe in shared creative romance.  characteristics i look for in a woman are an optimistic spirit, believes in something, is confident in herself to voice what she is thinking (i know double edge sword), has a quirky sense of humor, likes to dance, must love being outdoors more than indoors, appreciates good food, willing to try new things, has a good relationship with her family, knows how to treat and take care of her partner in crime and be an equal in a relationship. how's that for a list? i am not looking to rush into a relationship, with all that said, more than anything else, i want to meet some great people to create friendships and see if there is a connection. like everyone i am looking to find that spark, which i believe takes time and i think is worth waiting for."
796,"an east coast native who's spent the last 3 years living in san francisco after having lived in a lot of different places in the us and around the world. i've been fortunate to have immersed myself in different cultures, and made friends along the way.  whether i'm hiking mt tam, discovering a great brunch spot, or planning my bay to breakers costume, you'll rarely find me in my apartment. i am an extrovert, who is energized by meeting new people, and spending time with great friends, both when i'm in a relationship and when i'm on my own.  while i love my job in marketing strategy and am professionally ambitious, having balance is a life goal. most evenings i'm checking out a cool band, drinking wine over dinner with friends, taking a hula hoop class, or learning a new language. basically, if you suggest we try something out, i'm game!"
797,"i don't know what to type here. i can say i'm honest, and like to help people out. i'm detail orientated and practice good personal hygiene. and i am no good at writing personal summaries as i find them awkward and difficult to write. it's hard for me to put myself into a block of text but i will do my best to try.  i run, not because i like to, but because i have to. i'm not too fond of clubs or bars. i like things with wheels on it, particularly if they're shiny. that should be good enough for now.  if you want to know anything else, feel free to ask"

804,"travel,experience,independence,freedom,trust,and of course cool. these are what i am or what i seek. i am easy sometimes clumsy and fall into traps but learn from them. my ego is just right. i should add i am a very hard worker. i enjoy life by being involved rather than observing it. i have been through bad times and good times and i get over it. i am a very political and philosophical person i find that politics is a key factor in society (i dont meen the dirty mainstream ""politicians"") and philosophy paves the way for a humble life.(there is much more than that but im not going to get into depth you get the idea)  i am a elixir, considerate, and petrichor"

807,"i am new to the site, so i havent filled everything out yet. :)  love meeting new people, real people. an outstretched hand, a friend, maybe something more. i am a good guy, low maintenance, caring, affectionate, well traveled and educated. snarky, a little rough around the edges, volunteer for charities: trying to make a difference.  i also love a great adventure. i will try almost anything once including almost anything to eat at a dim sum. i have bungee jumped from the 3rd highest jump in the world, parachuted, kayaked, rock climbed, scuba dived, white water rafted and visited over 50 countries in my lifetime. i have lived for over a year out of a backpack. would you like to plan our next adventure together? :) :)  that said, i also like to be at home, and appreciate a home cooked meal and good company, going to concerts, plays and dive bars. friends are very important to me. there are so many wonderful venues to hang out at in san francisco, i have not been motivated to leave. i totally love it here, and believe that there are many adventures awaiting me without even leaving the city limits.  i tend to change my facial hair every so often, as you can see by my pics. right now i have a goatee. the pic of me and half dome is the most recent. tomorrow i might get a wild hair and shave the whole thing off. :)"

811,"i am definitely like water: calm and free-flowing like a lazy river ride (with water balloons ready to splash everyone of course!) but also with deep currents and a quiet power.  i guess you could say my demeanor is mostly laid-back and chillaxed. my sense of humor dry and deadpan. but with the right people im prone to silliness and have an irreverent sense of humor.  im one of those people that have to stay in motion and love to stay active. bicycling, capoeira, hiking, camping, and dancing all kind of work better with more than one person. that same can be said of being mentally active. reading, writing, art-ing, thinking, analyzing, theorizing, conceptualizing, and imagining are all kind of necessary for me. i work in arts education at a cultural institution so love museums and galleries, cultural events, music and performance arts. although i do regularly take quiet time to process and find meaning in all that activity.  i like those who are deep thinkers but still know how to get silly and have fun. i know the city is filled with intelligent, energetic, and active people so lets get to know each other! although, just to be fair, if youre a cannibal, neo-nazi, or vampire, i just dont think it would work out. well, actually, a vampire might be ok depending on the circumstances and the nature of the vampiric condition."

821,"well...i consider myself an artist and life my canvas. i love learning anything new so i'm always experimenting - because why wouldn't you, life is short. it could be trying a new recipe, painting with acrylics/oils, yoga, staging a photo shoot, creating an iphone app (i love technology), sound healing (alternative therapies are cool), to my most recent project of making hydroponic planters from wine bottles. so i guess you could say i'm curious.  i have a degree in biology, a degree in chemistry and a minor in physics...which makes me completely nerdy (i fly my nerd flag proud) but i'm also creative, artistic, and very introspective. i'm a deep thinker. i definitly live in my own bubble and enjoy spending time with my thoughts.  i also enjoy climbing rocks, surfing, drinking tea and reading. i'm actually always reading. it goes back to that curiosity thing.  my biggest passion is food. i eat lots of it, learn about it and even write about it. my newest thing is drinking green smoothies, who knew they'd be so good.  there's so much more about me but i guess this is a good start."

823,"i grew up in the midwest, central illinois, escaped to chicago where i supposedly studied music, and wound up in san francisco. now i write sas programs (i don't know how i learned to do this) because music degrees are worth as little to most as i suspected from the get go. fortunately i like to program, but another few years in front of a computer all day is going to kill me. fifty years ago i would undoubtedly have become an inventor. that pretty much sums it up i think. oh, and i like to cook but have become disenchanted by an electric stove. actually there's plenty more but i already feel as though i've said too much and that you may actually be very bored by now, especially if this is the fiftieth profile you've read in the last twenty minutes."

835,"it is hard to convey who you are and what is important to you in a few short paragraphs but here is my attempt.  my life has been a fun ride so far. i had opportunities to travel, learn, work on and do things that interest me. i was born and brought up in cosmopolitan india (calcutta) in a pleasant and loving environment.  i think exposure to diversity in terms of people, culture, languages, countries also helps define who we are, especially our unconscious self. i consider myself fortunate on both these fronts. i also value compassion. it lets me ""feel"" what the other person is feeling, talking about, and understand their point of view. i have clicked with folks who share and value some of these attributes.  with those basics taken care of, i believe sky is the limit in terms of adventure and experience. i have very few inhibitions and i am always willing to try anything new, especially if it is crazy and off-the-beaten path. i like history, especially stories of ordinary folks doing extraordinary things. italy, (especially the riviera/tuscany) and london are my favorite places to visit. i can never get tired of them.  i am a tenured academic in a famous university not very far from san francisco. in fact, the academic job gives me the flexibility to do fun things whenever i want to, especially given that i have excellent students. i work hard and try to have fun whenever possible.  i live in san francisco. my hobbies are travel, movies, museums, and writing. i am a member of the sf film society and i like going to their special screenings, previews, workshops etc and occasionally to booksmith in the haight to meet and hear writers i like."

840,"i'm a pretty independent guy who likes to try new things, including this, and prefers a nice ""work to relaxation"" ratio. i love to travel and have been to europe and asia many times. at first i'm a little shy but i tend to open up quickly. right now i'm not too picky on what i'm looking for on this; whatever happens, happens."
841,"so here's my story...  i'm a transplant from mexico. moved to the bay area to study psychology but ended up staying. fell in love with the people and the culture.  genuine, loyal, dependable, warmhearted, and loving. a free spirit with a very curious mind. if there is something that catches my interest, i want to try it or learn how to do it. after all, we only live once.  i prefer to believe in the good nature of people. perhaps this may sound a bit naive, but i would much rather trust and be open than to live holding back.  having a healthy mind, body, and soul is important to me. as busy as i my schedule gets, i make it a point to take care of myself. it all goes hand in hand.  i appreciate the beauty of the outdoors. big sur & mendocino are some of my favorite spots. i enjoy camping, going for a nice long hike, or a picnic on a sunny day.  as i was watching caddyshack the other day, i stumbled upon this rad chevy chase quote... ""there is a force in the universe that makes things happen and all you have to do is get in touch with it. stop thinking. let things happen and be"". i think this is going to be my approach on okcupid."

845,"i love life, my dog, my career, rock climbing, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, cars, motorcycles, spelunking, exploring ancient ruins, listening to music, playing music, programming, working out, going to concerts, and meeting new people (in no particular order).  i'm italian, passionate, adventurous, spontaneous, and love being with good company.  i'm not very well traveled and finally have the means to do so, so i'm excited to get my travel on. my ideal companion would be down to leave the country on a given weekend without notice just for fun."
846,"i've found a pretty good balance between being active and taking it easy. most summer weekends i'll round up some friends to go hiking, camping, traveling, climbing, canoeing and other adventures. if it's rainy or foggy, i'm happy staying in bed with a book or a movie for awhile and ambling out for a late brunch.  more and more i'm thinking less about what i want to do and more about what kind of impact i want to have on the world.  i tend to be up to many things at once and have been simplifying this habit lately.  i really like doing things in community though i am just as likely to be seen setting out and doing my own thing. i tend to gravitate toward people who are curious about their own development and growth, but who also don't take things too seriously.  apparently i still look like i'm about 30. this is generally a blessing, though there are some situations when it's less advantageous."

848,"hello! pull up a chair, get cozy. can i get you something to drink? water, juice, a beer, a glass of wine or my favorite some port? so you want to know a little about me? i have lots of stories, as i'm sure you do, but we can wait on that for another time. i've been in san francisco since 1987 and feel i have so much to under cover here. driving over the golden gate bridge always takes my breath away.  i've done many things with my life and am hoping that is not going change. i've traveled to many countries, where to next? last fall i learned how to surf. i'm hooked...but don't spend nearly enough time trying to ride the little mushy waves. i also just started sup. it's fantastic! my friends i learned with are spending the summer in tahoe....care to join me?  you can find me on several mornings swimming out in the ocean. this is my sanctuary. i was invited by a dear friend. i didn't realize how truly krazy this is.......no wetsuits!  after many years of living next to golden gate park i moved across the city for sunshine. as wonderful as it is being near the pulse of mission, i dearly miss the park. it's the soul of the city. so you will find me venturing across the city to find solace in the park. i love hiking through the redwood groves, the rose garden, so many hidden treasures. the big bonus is the de young museum. it's fun to duck in and then exit through the back and continue the adventure.  below is from the foreword of one of my favorite books; aphrodite, a memoir of the senses by isabel allende. it speaks eloquently to the realm of senses. how food and life are truly inter-meshed. the five senses and five elements are so important to human existence, yet many forget.  ""her breath is like honey spiced with cloves, her mouth delicious as ripened mango. to press kisses on her skin is to taste the lotus, the deep cave of her navel hides a store of spices what pleasure lies beyond, the tongue knows but cannot speak of it"" -srngarakarika"
849,"while my relationship requirement above says, ""looking for relationship"" or some variation thereof, i'm not necessarily looking to delve into a serious commitment. for each person you meet, there is a unique chemistry; some are intended to be friendships, some are more. i am honest, easy to be around, and intelligent, but also can be incredibly silly and love to laugh.  my interests are varied, not due to a lack of passion, but rather a passion for many things. my intention is not to be a contradiction, but i find there is so much to enjoy that i refuse to be limited. i love to read, but am prone to finding most of my time spent in social situations, be it dinners, parties, clubs, art or film openings, or just grabbing drinks with friends. i enjoy cooking a meal and sharing a bottle of wine with a movie at home, but also am a fan of trying that new restaurant before heading to a film festival. while i am working on my cooking skills and tend to lean toward cooking vegan at home, i'm not afraid to order lamb or squab in a restaurant. i love going to live shows and end up purchasing more tickets than number of shows i attend, but the promise or potential of making it there is too tempting to pass up. as of late, i've been listening to indie rock and electronic music, they seem to intersect in some odd and interesting places, but my roots are in alternative rock and i confess to indulging on occasion. i'm a member of a fair number of wine clubs and also an organic sake club; i alternate between having the selections shipped (who doesn't like getting gifts in the mail...even if you've already paid for them yourself) or taking a four day weekend up to rent a house and make a mini-trip out of it."
850,"i am a good natured person, to my core. i am alllll about honesty and respect and treating people well on this earth here and now. i am goofy/a bit weird but most people find me charming. i definitely don't take myself too seriously and sometimes i want to shake the negative energy out of a person. i am artistic and want to make things that are, beyond anything, beautiful. well, that and thought provoking. i am always a good and loyal friend to my homies, it's a big part of my identity. i am open-minded and make my own paths in this life. i'm looking for my next adventure. i really want to go hang gliding or something like this (already been sky-diving twice). i take joy in the little things and hope i never lose my child-like inclinations to climb a tree etc. i thoroughly enjoy getting dirty and working hard but i am also really good at kicking it.  i am honest, loopy, and chill"

852,"i moved to sf for the second time a few months ago, and have been enjoying the californian weather ever since. i'm working at a web startup, so i don't have much free time, but i make up for it at the weekends.  this summer i travelled from france to turkey overland through the balkans. i love travelling, especially the unplanned, grab a backpack, and leave with no deadlines kind. one of the finest things in life is getting lost in a strange city, and spending the day wandering beneath foreign buildings.  i'm an unashamed adrenaline addict. if there's a river and a cliff then i'll jump off it. swimming in cold water under the sun, or looking down from the top of a mountain, both are good days in my book.  i am adventurous, funny, and scottish"
853,"i'm a pretty easy going and laid-back guy. i enjoy outdoor activities: hiking, biking, playing soccer and trail running. i dig listening to new music and playing around with a guitar. i like to dork out on science and technology."
854,"hellooooooo! sarcasm is entertaining. i love water and disneyland. i enjoy a party and having a great time, all the time. tea is one of my most favorite things in life as well as my kitty, lola and music. i would say i'm quite social, i love fashion and learning."

912,"i walk the long way around, uphill if i have the choice. i make music, i go to see music being made. when i eat and drink, i try to thoroughly enjoy and respect the experience.  i don't always summarize well.  i eavesdrop liberally in public but scrupulously avoid it in private. i try to save up my swearing for when it's really unexpected; or when i'm moderately drunk.  i grew up listening to factories in ohio, train yards, tornado sirens. i still find those sounds somewhat comforting.  i have ink on my hands a lot. and chain grease. but i clean up well.  scruffly nonmaterialist bacchanalian creative types of any further description or gender have an advantage in getting my attention.  i really aim to just tell the truth, pretty much all the time. if you don't pretty much do that too, it's not going to work.  i'm queer. i don't like reinforcing this idea that there are any fixed number of choices in love, gender, behavior, relationships. i feel and want and am different things at different times, and i really really think that's ok.  i love meeting people, and i have a lot of friends who i love dearly. i consider sharing my emotional life with people just as intimate as sharing anything physical. partner, best friend, confidante, support, emotional rock, lover - i have all those kinds of people in my life, thank god. sometimes more than one. would it bother you that i don't need you to be everything for me? i'd rather you're just really good at being yourself, however weird you are. your weirdness is what i'm going to like about you.  i'm not going to be at all surprised if i eventually want to couple up with someone. that'll be great, especially if they want the same thing. i think i'll be even better at having that kind of relationship next time than i was the last time. and the last time went great. i'm not searching, i'm not lacking, i'm not avoiding. there's no telling what could happen next. would it bother you that i'm still friends with most of the people who i've dated? they're nice people, like you. i don't keep in touch with the crazies or the meanies.  facial hair comes and goes. its changes are a reminder of the impermanence of all things. its outrageousness, a reminder to remain playful."
913,"i'm an english professor at a small liberal arts university outside of berkeley, california. i'm also a nationally-known music journalist, and a native californian. i worked as a d.j. and a tennis pro before settling on education, which is kind of a combination of the two... i wrote a book about the stone roses. it's called ""the stone roses""... i'm the editor of an online music magazine. 5'7"", curly brown hair, blue eyes. athletic, poet, love music..."
914,"for a better idea, read below..."
915,"i'm not a person that is in search of themselves. i've known all my life who i was and never questioned it. i am batman.  so i'm not a huge outdoorsy person, my childhood was spent mostly in front of the tv/nintendo. i don't believe that 80% of the users on this site love hiking as much as they say they do.  i have a dinosaur tattoo and have marc maron's phone number. i have an mc hammer doll in the box and own a crock pot. i will eat dessert. i regret my screen name because guys send me messages calling me double d. i've seen every episode of futurama. i have a love hate with capitalization of words. i love to wear dresses and eat with my hands. i'm probably debating having ice cream for dinner as you read this.  i'm moving to nyc in november, so don't fall in love, you big sap. i'm not looking for anything serious, but i still would like a profile where i can at least see your face.  i love memes. haha>lol.  i'm a pot smoker, but not like the stereotype. i'm quicker, organized and driven more than most non smokers. if you don't smoke, i'm okay with that. most of the time, i date men that don't. as long as you're cool with it, i am. i'm sure there's plenty things you do that i don't, and i won't keep you from.  in fact, feel free to take one of those hikes you love so much while i smoke.  ...to say i have a personality is a bit of an understatement."
916,"i love contact with living creatures. the beach is my favorite place followed closely by other bodies of water.  traveling and being outdoors invigorates me.  in my free time i like to go rock climbing, make music, cook delicious treats, and spend time with my lovely friends drinking wine, dancing unabashedly, playing board and or video games, and signing karaoke."
917,"i am an explorer of science, ideas, culture, film, and novel experiences. i grew up in the deep south (which surprises many people), went to school near boston, moved to seattle for two years on a whim, went to chicago for graduate studies, and moved to the bay area to use my new degree. i decided on a thursday to move, wrote an algorithm to help me pack my car, and started driving the following sunday.  i used to want to meet someone and seek experiences that would completely change the way i view the world. nowadays, i am more interested in small moments that build, discovering new aspects of life, and getting better at things a little every day. that doesn't mean that i don't do things on a whim or occasionally stay out way too late. i just live by the philosophy that fortune favors the prepared mind and think that the case can be made for moderation. that may sound boring, but i believe that it's ultimately fulfilling. yes, i practice moderation in moderation.  i am unconventional, innovative, and a cautious/recovering idealist."
918,"i'll keep it short, i'm very easy to get along with and i love making other people laugh 24/7. people tell me i make them feel comfortable right away...i appreciate that. :)  love the 49'ers/sf giants/warriors/sharks love spa's love baseball love humor love ethnic women love new socks love grilled cheese"
919,"my name is kristia. born and raised in new jersey and just moved to san francisco. i am a singer/songwriter. i absolutely love traveling and will take advantage of it whenever i'm given the chance to. i try to keep myself busy majority of the time because it keeps me motivated and content. i am honest and forward with everyone that i meet. after personal experiences, there is no need to hold back. i am constantly moving forward and won't let anything get in my way. to some i might come off as a bitch, but i just know what i want. i really am nice, though."
920,"mindful, helpful, committed, ethical, loyal, grounded, self-aware. native new yorker, cynic, lefty libertarian, deviant, mildly kinky, devil's advocate. techie. educator. intj and 2w3 if you're into personality tests.  i'm an introvert, but very good at playing the extrovert. i'm more grounded in reality than i'd like to be. i value trust. i like variety in experiences, emotions, and states of being; i don't trust people who are happy or sad all of the time or never seek new skills or spend their whole lives in one place or in one job.  i try not to be judgmental, but i get righteously indignant about my pet causes, which usually involve corporate greed, political shenanigans, or personal stupidity. i try to make the world a better place personally and professionally. i vote with my dollar. i believe it's a moral imperative to give bad drivers the finger (which part of ""turn signal"" do californians not understand?) or else they'll never learn and will continue to violate the legal and social contract represented by a driver's license. i vacillate between hitchens / dawkins atheism and ""who knows?"" agnosticism. i find secular humanism appealing.  i have little interest in reality television, rabid sports fanaticism, or blind brand loyalty. if you're into any of those things you are welcome to them. i'll be over there in the corner not rolling my eyes and making snarky comments in judgement.  i like to experiment and i'll try anything once, although at this point in my life i can predict with some certainty whether i will enjoy an experience. please don't ask me to pee on you. on the other hand, if your idea of kink is leaving the lights on, we're not a match. i rarely get altered any more but i reserve the right to do so. i still smoke a cigarette or two a day. give me some other enjoyable vice to satisfy my oral fix and i'll quit completely.  i enjoy a mix of active and lazy - whatever suits my mood. i enjoy the great outdoors, loungey/divey bars, house parties, clubs, finding great places to eat, and laying in bed until late in the morning. i'm not a big fan of the gym but i like to hike and dance. i love howweird and folsom and santacon and hunky jesus and bigwheel and bay to breakers and makers faire and any of the other great participatory cultural events that make the bay area so much fun.  yes, i am on facebook, tribe, linkedin, skype, fetlife, and every im service. no, you can't be my friend until we meet and hit it off."

922,"the last of a dying breed of natives of this area. slowly being pushed out by people very foreign to this gorgeous city. i guess you can say that you don't come around people like me too often.  like you, i'm also wondering how the hell i got on to this site to begin with. the short answer is that i still have some hope, albeit very remote....... perhaps unrealistic that you can meet someone in this town that without being 2 to 10 beers/drinks deep. so here i am, lame profile and all.  as for who and what i am? i guess you can say i'm a mixture of many things and i tend to get along with people very well because in some weird way or another, life has unfolded for me in a way that it has given me many things in common with others. one odd or very distinct experience after another that has helped shape me into this easy going, hard working, funny, ambitious, genuine and responsible being that's not afraid of being himself, if anything i go out of my way to stay true to what and who i am."
923,"most of my energy goes into music, everything from spontaneous collaborations to well-orchestrated recordings. i also enjoy designing, making and modifying clothes. i like to invent recipes on the spot. i build furniture, art bicycles, and generally take joy in beautiful creations, whether others' or my own.  i get immersed in all manner of side projects: tuning pianos, building preamplifiers, burning, locating sources of colorful socks. i write letters and journals and read in order to make sense of the world and how to change it.  tendencies towards geekiness and radicalism cause me to not blend fully into most normative social constructs. i clean up nice when necessary, but i try to limit those affairs.  i'd like to meet intriguing people, especially if there is mutual attraction and interest in polymathematic collaboration.  i would like to find someone to live with, as well as find potential lovers, conversationalists, activists and musical and other collaborators. could that be you?"
924,i'm not homeless.
925,hello. i'm a law student spending a two week vacation at my grandmother's in san francisco. just checking into okc here in the bay to see who's around.
926,"i work and travel a lot. as such, i stay ""busy"" most of the time. genuinely new ideas are the most exciting thing in the world to me. i enjoy life a lot more than the previous two statements seem to imply."

928,"i grew up in the bay area, started college in boston and finished in berkeley, did a lot of traveling and moved back to san francisco about 3 years ago. i'm generally upbeat and i enjoy getting excited - i've worked a lot with kids and some of their ability to delight in small things has rubbed off on me. i like exploring the city, hiking, and going to shows. i love trying new things and while i'm no star athlete, i have a lot of fun playing."
929,"constantly learning about myself, i find that the process is much easier when there is a companion. that's what really brought me to this site. there is only so much i could look for at the clubs on a saturday evening."
930,"just moved the bay area for work. still exploring the place. love it so far. i am designer. calm. sociable. happy. active. i also really enjoy a good beer. i'm pretty strait forward, honest, reliable and loyal."
931,"i like golf, skydiving, writing, data, startups and cooking--but i don't cook enough. i moved from new york to san francisco in 2007 and i don't miss winter--real winters, not 45 degrees and rainy. i do miss real pizza, bagels, sandwiches and yankee stadium.  i go out of my way to not waste time or energy since they're the only two things i can't get more of.  i keep a list of quotes that i like and look at it when i'm trying to write something interesting."
932,"i grew up on in the north east, lived in denver for a while, and moved to ca 2 years ago. i love music. i have recently been on a electronica binge, but if i can dance to it i'll enjoy it."
933,"i fucking cherish authenticity, compassion, creating a sense of belonging, and selective ass kicking where appropriate. and apparently, swearing like a sailor.  i requiredoing what you sayfrom myself and others.  i love what i do and it doesn't feel like work. i don't usually talk a lot and this list is starting to reveal that.  i have used a lot of confusing psychological pain as the door to a lot of peace and it is awesome. i am abnormally happy, but with the perspective of having been abnormally miserable.  i can be a dork and don't feel like i look or act much like a grownup on the outside.  i am passionate about truth and freedom, and if it isn't all in your heart, at least it starts there.  ^ shouldn't i rewrite this so it's not a bunch of sentences that start with i. i bet i won't.  if you want to talk about adya that would be extra cool."
934,"i love all sorts of things, and am interested in everything creative, especially where art and science come together. i feel that the best way for someone to make a mark on the world is by making new things that others can enjoy. so, i am always learning to make new things.  i live in san francisco, i own my own home, and i'm looking for someone i can share my interests with, and who can share their interests with me.  i'm not terribly interested in a sexual relationship (i consider myself both asexual and neutrois/genderless/epicene) and i would consider a romantic relationship with someone of any gender or lack thereof, although i definitely prefer guys. i'm still a virgin but only because of lack of interest in sex.  i am aloof, multifaceted, and flighty"
935,"hi! i'm honest, genuine, humble, loyal, quirky, a good listener, and affectionate...  i came to the us from another country twelve years ago. i'm going to let you try and work out what country it was. maybe something in my profile provides a valuable hint?  the funny accent is still there, but it's fast disappearing. admittedly i didn't exactly come from a developing country, but i had nothing when i stepped off the plane except what was stuffed into my suitcases and a strong desire to be the best that i could be here. since i'm not from around these parts, my opinions and humor can be a little different to what some may expect.  i also lived in southern california when i first came to the us (never again!), and i was fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to live in montana for a short period as well. when i was younger, i also lived on the island paradise of fiji for a few years.  a recent passion has been learning to dance. for just over a year, i've been learning several varieties of ballroom dance including cha-cha, foxtrot, hustle, rumba, salsa, swing, tango and waltz. if you noticed that those were listed in alphabetical order, then top marks to you. by day i'm a meek, mild manner engineer, but at night i turn into a dancing machine! it's a great feeling to learn a new step, and then to actually execute it well with a partner who doesn't know it's coming.  when i'm not dancing, you may find me playing tennis or squash. for those that don't know, squash may on first appearances look somewhat similar to racquetball, except that racquetball absolutely sucks.  my sense of humor is self deprecating, black, and i like mocking those in authority and those on high moral ground are all fair game.  there are two philosophies that i try to live by. give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and if your afraid of something, confront it, and overcome that fear.  who am i looking for? i don't have a laundry list. the type of person i think i may be most attracted to is probably positive, a little adventurous, has a curious mind, and may have been exposed to different cultures during her life. bonus points if you can dance. double bonus points if you don't have a clue how to dance but would like to learn!"
936,"i like baby seals, scientists, & programmers. i also like people who use the oxford comma.  sometimes i say outrageous or ridiculous things that shouldn't be taken too seriously."

943,"hate this...well i'm pretty funny most of the time especially if you get my super geeky jokes and geek culture references. today i've decided that what i don't like defines me better than just listing stuff i like so with that in mind:  dislikes: the new yorker, hippie-crites. bad drivers. bananas. thai food. little yap-yap dogs, woody allen movies. mark twain. superman, god i hate that smug son of a bitch!  likes: sci-fi, books, movies, cooking, hiking, dogs. i'm a food snob. i wear lots of black clothing but i think it's more out of laziness at this point than a self-image thing.  i am geeky, eloquent, and stuff"
944,"i love myself, so i am not looking for someone to love me, but for someone to love. i believe a relationship is not something that completes you, but something that enhances your life.  i am tall, dark and athletic, you'll be 19 to 29 years old, physically fit and attractive, and confident enough to have your own life without a boyfriend who tells you how wonderful you are every 12 minutes. i don't mind what height, hair color or skin color you are, but i do ask that you are slim. preferably with gym membership .. that you actually use .. more than once every 6 months."

947,"after a long stint as a professional student i'm still eager to learn new things. i love to travel but nothing beats the comfort of my own bed. i have never not lived near the ocean (except for that year i lived in london) and i love the city but crave the country. i've been known to dance around my apartment to loud music by myself and sometimes i eat ice cream for dinner. i have too many pairs of shoes and not enough space and i have plans to save the world, but somehow got sidetracked. i'll always root for the underdog and i'll always procrastinate (but i do some of my best work at the last minute), and i'll try anything once (as long as it doesn't involve bugs)."

951,"i'm spending a lot of time in the san francisco bay area for work and am looking to make new friends while i'm down here. i actually live in edmonton, alberta, canada most of the time. i think in celsius and kilometres and don't get this whole fahrenheit thing at all. the following is taken from my edmonton profile, overbose.  let's see. i am: geeky, poly, kink and sex-positive, an ally of the queer community, weird, argumentative, socially progressive (to say the least), fiscally centrist (more accurate: quirky -- small government but focusing on social programs and not defense), a big believer in equality of all forms (but there may be disagreement on what that means), a ravenous consumer of books, a theatre-geek with no credentials in theatre, a fan of video games (especially older ones: nothing will ever beat zelda link to the past or super metroid), an active twitter user, a programmer, a cyclist, a daoist in a non-spiritual sense, and many many other things.  i am in a primary relationship with 1istener, who is awesome in many many ways. she's a musician who goes by the name of must be tuesday. our relationship is non-monogamous, which you might guess when you hear her (relatively popular) song my boyfriend's girlfriend. i've also been with fierce_flawless for nearly a year, and so far it's a hell of a lot of fun. so i have my hands really full on the relationship side of things, but i'm always up for new and awesome friends."
952,"i'm warm, artistic, funny, and thoughtful. i'm also childish, impatient, afraid of insects, slightly neurotic, and evil. i'm good at drawing, painting, snuggling, doing crafty things, and cooking. i'm terrible at playing most sports, doing math, and watching scary movies. i think puppies > children."
953,"i am more than just a pretty face. i am a national geographic subscriber and i am still waiting for my free world map. i am obsessed with turning keyboards upside down and thumping the dirt particles out of them. i am also oddly interested in studying ocean life while listening to death metal, grindcore or electronic music. i am slightly obnoxious and wholly loud, and i always make inappropriate and tactless jokes to strangers fully aware of the fact that they have no idea how much i'm laughing inside. i sometimes drink alcohol in bad taste. i sometimes intentionally get no sleep so the next day i can watch extreme makeover: home edition, and sob more than i would when well-rested. i enjoy the release. i have a distaste for a minuses, i cannot stand them either, and repeat crazy phrases to myself such as ""a minuses are just another name for second place, which, in turn, is just another name for losing"" in order to maintain a perfect 4.0. i am very selectively obsessive compulsive, and will leave my crap everywhere (which is just the way i like it), but iron things unnecessarily because i can't stand wrinkles. . i also regularly make wish-lists on various shopping websites, and i delete them each month without ever purchasing anything and start again. i look forward to being middle-aged and opening up a pit bull sanctuary. i also look forward to being old and taking cruises to third world countries. i can never read captchas."
954,"(some people miss this...april fool's!...don't take this first section seriously. i didn't expect to have to explain this. the rest is true though.)  i have reached a point in my life where i am older, more maturelet's face it i am ready to settle down. i figured this was the way to do it. surely this is the way to meet that one special woman. i don't mean this is a chance to meet a bunch of women, have some fun, and perhaps (if i am lucky) one of those could lead to a significant relationship. i figure the first woman i meet on here would be perfect. how hard can it be? i mean, i can see all of the things you consider important, you can see all of the things i consider important, we can see photos of one another. clearly nothing can go wrong with this process. i figure i will be engaged by april first!  so what am i looking for in a woman?  intelligence is important. i don't need a woman who is a rocket scientist, but i do need you to understand me well enough so that when i tell you to do something i can be sure it will be understood and executed properly. i suppose an ivy league degree would give me the necessary confidence that you could do this. though, i would prefer a masters degree.  i like women who are attractive; i believe i deserve a woman who is attractive. i used to play lots of sports, so i used to have a fit body, and i used to have all of my hair. so clearly you should have some modeling in your background. i figure you were probably the spokes model for a high end make up line, and just to show your versatility you probably modeled swimsuits recently too.  though in ""real space"" i am already pretty flexible when it comes to age, i should probably open it up a bit online to help widen my search, let's say 23-27.  it is always nice if we can share some things in common. because i used to play sports it would be nice if you also did something. maybe you can run a marathon in 3:10 or so. well, that may not be fair, some people are built more for speed or quickness than endurance. it only makes sense that i would also accept something like an 11.5 second 100 meter dash or maybe a 34 inch vertical leap. it would also be nice if we could enjoy watching sports together, but i don't want to have to explain things to you. to make sure you know a little bit about college football you should be able to tell me the teams of the the bigx or the sec (by conference of course.) ideally you would be able to name all of those, but i don't want to be ridiculous and ask for too much."
955,"hey there! i'm a bay area native who recently moved back after living on the east coast for a couple of years. i like to think i'm pretty low-key and open minded. i love to laugh. sarcasm is kind of my thing. i drive stick, so you can say i'm hardcore. less so when near spiders. i'm always up for a new adventure and look forward to exploring the east bay a bit more this summer."

970,i'm in sf for a couple of weeks. i'm aussie. i like art and coffee and wine and beer and dancing.
971,"my general aim in life is to keep things simple, which is typically pretty difficult. this profile is probably a good example; agonizing over the details while keeping it loose and not overly deterministic will probably make me sound super dry and straightforward.  ummm... success!"
972,
973,"need to rewrite this part of the profile. the previous was from a few years back, so stay tuned.  i am annoyingly able to, talk you in circles, and cleverly"
974,"software entrepreneur (sans delusions of grandeur), erstwhile libertarian (who's since seen the light), armchair philosopher (with a penchant for parentheticals).  i work a lot, but i decide exactly when and love that freedom. i value my time, and it's not unusual for me to cut out to enjoy a warm, sunny day or go on a day trip somewhere interesting. while my profession skews nerdy, i appreciate well-rounded people and those who can think big.  i love riding my motorcycle (a honda 919, thanks for asking) and also enjoy bicycling (bike party!) and wandering around in general. i'm fascinated by deep philosophical questions, cosmology, and good storytellers. i have a small dog and he is awesome."
975,"i'm a nerd at heart. i just recently graduated from usf with my degree in chemistry. i love watching hockey (go sharks!), cooking/baking, and blasting loud music when no one is home. i like to brew my own beer and am slowly working towards perfecting the chocolate chip cookie. i like going out but also enjoy staying indoors watching movies or playing videogames (yes i said i was a nerd). i also enjoy being outdoors snowboarding, surfing, and hiking. i'm also saving money to purchase a motorcycle so i would say i'm a tad adventurous ;)"
976,
977,
978,"coffee, nyt, crossword puzzle, reading a novel at the whiskey bar, museums, lectures, indie shows, bad movie night. in short, i don't summarize well."
979,"i'm australian born and raised, but with a regrettable lack of foreign accent and a love for san francisco that runs deep. i'm happiest amongst trees or at the edges of rivers. i hate american politics but can't look away."
980,"a little different. raised in a log cabin on a mountain in colorado (for real). mostly civilized, partially urbanized. happiest when skiing, dancing, or running a conference (or just running). had some good times on the playa (96-03, 06, 11), but i think those are behind me now. campouts with friends (and djs). learning the 3d structure of sf by running and biking over and through it (did you know there's a nice running trail right by the foot of sutro tower?). finding moments of reflection listening to the bubbling of my breath while swimming. watching the sky and listening for foghorns from the lower haight."
981,"i decided to write this sans ritalin, and if you can hang, gold star.  i am awesome and totally kick ass. sometimes. i used to breed reptiles. i still have a few. i like dogs, and animals, but i don't think cats are all that great. actually, i'd venture to say they are somewhat overrated. puppies are way cuter then kittens. i mean like, astronomically cuter.  i ride a bicycle. my bike is a pos. all my good bikes got stolen, and so i ride a pos. one of the breaks don't work, and the other doesn't work well. i ride a bike in the rain."
982,"i consider myself to be a gentleman and a scholar. i pick up pennies i find on the ground. i'm learning how to tig weld, which i love, but wish it didn't entail eating so many donuts. when i'm hiking or camping i tend to make bird/ alien noises. huge fan of succulents and prairie grasses. obsessed with the built environment."
983,i don't need a self-summery. okcupid has determined i'm in the top 10% of attractive people.
984,"i'm enjoy art, music, watching sports, the outdoors (especially the water and water sports), walks/hikes, movies, trying and learning new things, poker, family, and friends. i am looking to date and have fun with the intention of entering into a serious relationship with the right person. i like to laugh and appreciate all sorts of comedy. i can definitely appreciate a little sarcasm and wit. i love caring for and helping others."
985,"i just moved to san francisco after living for a few years in dc and nyc. so, recently been just taking it all in. sf is amazing. since i'm new to the area, thought it'd be fun to meet some new people.  i grew up having an amazing appreciation for good food & wine thanks to my mother ""the chef"" (i think thats why i read cookbooks for fun) and my motorcycle license thanks to my dad ""unrequited rebel who does calc for fun"" ... sort of turned out to be a well rounded kid i suppose. my family is highly entertaining; keeps me witty and laughing. at least i can say i look forward to our family trips. whether its saving my mother from drowning in a foot (yes 1) of water while we're snorkling in st. johns (i know, how on earth did she do that), trying to race my dad down the slopes during ski season, or making the youngest sister our dd while touring napa... we seem to always have a good time.  my friends describe me as genuine, with a self-depricating sense of humor which has always made for good stories. i'm laughing with you, while laughing at me.  if you had a bad day, i'll make you lemonade...and i'll spike it if you'd like. don't sweat the small stuff. i'm more optomistic than cynical. glass is half full kind of girl.  you can tell i'm nervous if i suddenly have a british accent.  despite the ever busy every day life, i always make it a point to stop and do something i love. i keep a well balanced life between work and play. i've been very blessed by the people i've met and the places i've seen, like most, i can't live w/o travel. you always find the most amazing, beautiful and awesome things in the most random places. see, taste, hear, be. it shapes you, molds you, creates you. i adhere to the saying ""pay it forward."" paying it forward is always key and i find it keeps life in check. i'm more of a get your hands dirty kind of girl. more action less talk. i spent last august in honduras building houses, fortunately my job lent me the ability to go m.i.a in order to do so.  besides the above, i like to kick it with friends, hop in a random class (sf is awesome in that regard), head outdoors, take a sunday drive, hop the ferry, cook for friends, relax or not relax, read, create, listen, hang with the fam, go to a giants game....etc etc etc"
986,"a little about me:  i'm a happy, easy going gal who appreciates inappropriate jokes. i enjoy dancing, laughing, playing volleyball, running, trimming my nails, playing boardgames, going to beer fests, singing disney songs around a campfire with friends, going on road trips, checking out new bars, doing outdoorsy type things, and being around witty people.  while i normally don't sweat the small stuff, stepping on water while wearing socks really bums me out.  also, smiling is my favorite (along with bullet points)."
987,"i'm a pretty chill girl who mainly likes fun things! e.g. playing guitar, dancing my pants off, laughing, hanging out w nature, exploring, cooking, learning about awesome things, and snuggling with my kitty."
988,"i love making music, indulging in food and wine, hanging with my eclectic group of friends, and thriving on newness. i've have a passionate spirit and a compassionate heart. i have been a voracious traveler for the last 10 years but am sorely overdue. one of the best things i've done that i'm most proud of is fund raise for and direct the rebuilding of a thai village in the months after the '04 tsunami. the big gift for me there was the incredible insight into how people show up in times of great stress and challenge, yet no one has anything to gain (nothing like crisis to see what people are made of). i have loved and lost and loved, each time figuring out some new piece to teach me how i need to be to make it work well. i have a ton of different interests, with music being by far the crown jewel, both seeing and playing live shows. i get out every weekend but am equally a total dinner-couch-movie guy. i run my own business, i'm a reader, i'm an amateur political and public policy pundit (wow lots of p's there), my cooking is getting more sophisticated (and vegetarian, but i still eat everything), i have a huge list of restaurants i'm working my way through, and as of last week was googling around for improv schools. who knows, sounds fun. :)"
989,i'm from los angeles but for some reason i speak with a bit of a twang. it gets much worse when i'm either nervous or drunk.
990,i'm an la girl cultured in dc and the bay. living life however i choose. a rebel without a cause... ;-p
991,"last year i moved back to sf after a long hiatus and i'm so happy to be back in the city that i love. sf has changed a bit in the 5 years that i was gone and i'm still trying to get through my list of new things to do and restaurants to try. it's always much more fun to share such experiences with someone else, so here i am.  i'm an east coast transplant, but i've been in ca long enough that i've shed most of the idiosynchrosies of the constitution state, although i can still be a bit sarcastic when needed.  in a past life i spent a fair amount of time living and working in mexico and central america. i love to travel and i'm excited about the prospect of planning trips to see other parts of the world. most recently, i got my dirndl on for oktoberfest in munich and hit the canals in amsterdam. any suggestions for my next adventure?"
992,"hey, my name is melissa im 21. im a singel mom to amazing little boy (: . im starting school next month im super excited for that.im going to be a preschool teacher (: .. im sweet and super nice. funny energetic, love having fun and making people laugh ohh and im totally random at times and i really dont.care what people say.about me.cuz. i like who i am anyways i hate drama so i stay away from it, i dont cheat. im.loyal to the guy im with. what i like in a guy or what i look for is a honest funny good personality, cute, tall i dont mind if hes older then me but not to much older like nobody over 30.lol. sorry :/ . he has to accept my son. (if your.worried about baby daddy drama.dont be there isnt any) thats pretty much it. if you want to get to know me better message me."
993,"i'm new here at okc, so thanks for stopping by. i'll be brief and do my best to make it worth the trip.  during college in chicago i wanted to write film music and become the next hans zimmer, but i've spent the past four years working with teams and projects in the entertainment industry. some of the highlights have been working with russell simmons (an odd pairing, but a great crash-course in hip hop) and a mock-wrestling match with dwayne ""the rock"" johnson in a recording booth. his 'crazy eyes' look is much scarier in person :)  i recently returned to sf after a head-clearing stint in southeast asia, and have decided to dive into sf's startup scene with the new goal of empowering people to make healthier choices. it's important to me that my work is creative and also brings a concrete benefit to peoples' lives.  i'm also dedicating 2012 to boxing and hang-gliding lessons (separately... for now), surviving my first triathlon, writing an album, establishing a daily yoga practice, figuring out how to get my siblings on a trip to europe, and perhaps finding the time for a few dates :)  so in closing, anonymous reader, drop me a line if you'd like to chat or have a laugh over a hot toddy or an old fashioned. and whatever brings you to okc - whether mundane or lofty - i wish you the best in finding it!"
994,"i'm a 30 year old college graduate; i have a total of three degrees. i'm a laid back person who's willing to try almost anything once, well accept for anything man on man lol. i'm a great cook, i can cook all types of stuff mexican, japanese and traditional black food (lol), i also baked a hell of a cheese cake. i enjoy outdoor activities, fishing, camping, hiking and going to the beach. no kids, completely drama free (no crazy ex's hanging around). i love animals, if i could do it all over again i would become a vet. i currently have 3 dogs, 2 english mastiffs named passion / chewbaka and a rottweiler named king tut. i'm family orientated love my moms to death. yes i have a job, i work at a sound engineering company based out of oakland, it's not my dream job but it pays the bills.i have 5 tattoos, across my back & stomach, the back of both arms and the side of my right arm. but enough about me, if you would like to know more go ahead and ask.  i'm looking for someone cool, my last relationship was an atomic bomb. im looking someone sane lol i don't think that's too much to ask. down to earth, family orientated, have goals in life, doesn't have a million children, 3 is my limit. if u have 3 kids by 3 different guys i'm not interested."
995,"new to sf! i am a fun loving, easy going kinda guy with high standards for myself. i have a twin brother, we're fraternal, and a younger brother. born and raised in southern california. im a huge lakers, ducks, and chargers fan. grew up playing basketball and roller hockey until college. i play a little piano, a little guitar, and enjoying singing. in my free time, i mostly watch movies, play with my dog, and go to the gym."
996,"i used to be able to say with impunity ""i'm weirder than you are.""  then i moved to san francisco.  when i was a kid i was often accused by adults of being ""too smart for [my] own damn good.""  i dress funny, i talk funny, and i think funny. i'm tired of being asked ""where are you from, anyhow?""  i only logged in here because everyone else was doing it and i figured it would give me a chance to stretch my wings on the way down.  now i work for legoog like everyone else smart enough to do so when the financial maelstrom hit.  i am irredeemable, irrepressible, and irreverent"
997,"a detroit native, i still retain some of my detroit sensibilities. in search of gold, made it to the ""best coast"" a little over three years ago."
998,
999,"i've lived here for the last 14 years. i love getting away, and i love coming back. i grew up in portland, oregon. favorite childhood memories include running among the trees near mt hood at summer camp while being a complete goofball. or scheming with the neighborhood kids (mostly weird kids - no idllyic nostalgia here) trying to figure out how many of us could fit on a skate board or how to make a zip line in the backyard without running into the dog.  recipes are my friend. i admire those that can cook without one. i also like turn signals. i'm allergic to cats and pineapple.  i don't eat peas, unless they're buried in paella or samosas or something that completely disguises their taste. and no, i don't really see this as being critical to who i am, just trying to write something other than the usual laundry list of eating out/wine tasting/hiking/etc. that 95% of us like to do. :)"
